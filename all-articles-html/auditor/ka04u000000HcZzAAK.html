    <h1>How to fix problems related to installing/uninstalling Compression Service on target host</h1>
    <h1>Symptoms</h1>

<ol><li>When removing Item, Data Source or Monitoring Plan from Netwrix Auditor, it&#39;s Compression Service Agents are not removed automatically from the Servers that are no longer being monitored.</li><li>After the upgrade of Netwrix Auditor, there are errors in Health Log that indicate that Compression Service Agents cannot be updated automatically.</li></ol>

<h1>Causes</h1>
Installation - Possible causes for an issue during installation are: there is a previous version of the Compression Service that cannot be uninstalled correctly, OS settings prevent installation of .msi package (e.g. Domain Policies, no permissions for Netwrix Account)<br>Uninstllation - Possible causes for an issue during removal are: Missing/corrupt installation package, corrupt registry keys that point to a nonexistent folder.
<h1>Solution</h1>
In this case, the Agents must be removed manually. Netwrix Auditor uses standard .msi packages to deploy its Compression Service Agents. In order to remove them, we recommend using Troubleshooting Software provided by Microsoft here: <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/fix-problems-that-block-programs-from-being-installed-or-removed-cca7d1b6-65a9-3d98-426b-e9f927e1eb4d" target="_blank">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/fix-problems-that-block-programs-from-being-installed-or-removed-cca7d1b6-65a9-3d98-426b-e9f927e1eb4d</a><br><br><b>NOTE:</b> All operations must be done on the <b>Target </b>server, not on the server where Netwrix Auditor is installed. If there are multiple affected Target servers, the operation must be done on each one of them separately.<br><br>There are two possible scenarios:
<h3>The agent cannot be installed on the target host</h3>

<ol><li>Run the <b>troubleshooter </b>program that was downloaded form Microsoft Website</li><li>click <b>Next </b>and select <b>Uninstalling </b>option,</li><li>find and select the corresponding name of the Compression Service Agent in the list and follow the steps to complete the procedure.</li><li>If data collection with compression service is enabled for this server, Compression Service will then be automatically installed by Auditor.</li></ol>
If the agent name is not in the list, then run the troubleshooter again and select <b>Installing </b>option, select the name of the agent in the list and complete the procedure.

<h3><br>The agent cannot be uninstalled on the target host</h3>

<ol><li>Run the <b>troubleshooter </b>program that was downloaded form Microsoft Website</li><li>click <b>Next </b>and select <b>Uninstalling </b>option,</li><li>find and select the corresponding name of the Compression Service Agent in the list and complete the procedure.</li></ol>
If you follow the instructions, but the problem still persists, contact Netwrix Technical Support.<br>ï¿½
