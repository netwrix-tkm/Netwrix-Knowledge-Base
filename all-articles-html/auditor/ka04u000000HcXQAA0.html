One of the required ports is blocked by Firewall.

<hr></hr>

To resolve the issue, make sure the following ports are opened:
<ol><li>TCP 135 and TCP 445 are opened both ways.</li><li>Dynamic RPC ports range are opened from the server where the Netwrix product is installed to the monitored server. The product uses these ports to connect to the monitored servers and launch the agent services. You can open the ports in two ways:</li></ol>
<ul><li>Open the following TCP ports range on your Firewall:</li></ul>
<blockquote>for Windows Vista/7/2008: 49152-65535
for Windows XP/2003: 1024-5000</blockquote>
<ul><li>Alternatively, you can configure a custom Dynamic RPC ports range on the managed server, for example you can configure ports 50000-50200 and open these ports in your Firewall. For detailed instructions, please refer to the following Microsoft KB article: <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/154596" target="_blank">How to configure RPC dynamic port allocation to work with firewalls</a>.</li></ul>
