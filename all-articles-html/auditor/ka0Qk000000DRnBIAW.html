    <h1>Managed Objects Disappear After Disk Space on System Drive Fills Up</h1>
    Sometimes after filling up the space on the system drive your managed objects may disappear.  The root cause has not yet been determined.  For now the best thing to do is to restore the NetwrixChangeReporterConfig.xml file from backup.  This file can be found in the following location by default: C:ProgramDataNetWrixManagement Console.  Prior to doing the restore of this file please create a support ticket on our Customer Portal and send us a copy of the NetwrixChangeReporterConfig.xml file that you have (pre-restore version).  This will allow us to gather more data to reproduce this issue and understand the root cause.
The Customer Portal can be found at the following URL:
