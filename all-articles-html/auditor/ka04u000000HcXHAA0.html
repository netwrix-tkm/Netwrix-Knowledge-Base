    <h1>How Netwrix Ensures Safety of Stored Credentials</h1>
    <h3>Data Protection</h3>



<p>Netwrix Auditor leverages accounts with privileges considered higher than regular users&quot; for target systems configuration, access, and data collection. Therefore, credentials of those accounts must be stored on the Netwrix Auditor server in a secure manner. <br><br>For that, Netwrix Auditor utilizes a native Microsoft Windows cryptographic mechanism called Data Protection API (DPAPI) based on <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/seccrypto/cryptography-portal" target="_blank">Crypto API</a>. Detailed information on DPAPI implementation by Microsoft can be found in <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/ms995355(v=msdn.10)?redirectedfrom=MSDN#windataprotection-dpapi_topic04" target="_blank">Windows Data Protection</a>.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">The
benefits of this approach areï¿½</p>



<ul><li>Usage of DPAPI is recommended by Microsoft for encryption of sensitive data at rest (such as passwords or <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/data-protection/implementation/key-encryption-at-rest?view=aspnetcore-3.0#windows-dpapi" target="_blank">master keys</a>). Also, DPAPI is used by Microsoft services to store credentials      (e.g., Remote Desktop Connection).</li><li>DPAPI is built-in in the Microsoft Windows operating      system. Therefore, all enhancements, updates and security bug fixes are      provided through regular Windows Update.</li><li><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/seccrypto/cryptography-portal" target="_blank">CryptoAPI</a>      under the hood of DPAPI uses proven cryptographic algorithms such as AES      256-bit for data encryption. They can be adjusted to the specific needs of      a company through <a href="" target="_blank">Cryptographic      Service Providers</a> configuration.</li><li>Master keys used by DPAPI for data encryption are managed by Microsoft Windows OS; third-party applications and Netwrix Auditor, in particular, do not access or control them.  </li></ul>

<p class="has-text-color" style="color: #0c70b8;font-size: 30px;">Frequently Asked Questions</p>



<p><strong>Q:</strong> What cryptographic algorithm is used for encryption?<br><strong>A:</strong> Since Netwrix Auditor relies on DPAPI instead of directly handling encryption, the actual mechanism is defined by the Windows operation system. Netwrix does not have control over selection of cryptographic algorithms. <br><br><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/seccrypto/cryptography-portal" target="_blank">CryptoAPI</a> under the hood of DPAPI uses proven cryptographic algorithms for data encryption such as AES 256-bit.<br><br></p>



<p><strong>Q:</strong> What if someone unauthorized gets a copy of the <em>Configuration.xml</em> file on another machine and then tries to decrypt passwords stored in it?<br><strong>A:</strong> Microsoft Data Protection API provides mechanism to associate encrypted data with the machine context. Netwrix uses this approach by utilizing CRYPTPROTECT_LOCAL_MACHINE flag for encryption. This ensures that the data can be decrypted only on the same machine it has been encrypted on.<br><br></p>



<p><strong>Q:</strong> What should Netwrix administrators do to keep Netwrix Auditor as secure as possible?<br><strong>A: </strong>The most important thing is to limit access to the Netwrix Auditor server. Just authorized personnel should have access to the Netwrix Auditor server.</p>



<p>The
access level must be thoroughly adjusted as well; regular Netwrix Auditor users
don&quot;t need the local Administrators rights. </p>
