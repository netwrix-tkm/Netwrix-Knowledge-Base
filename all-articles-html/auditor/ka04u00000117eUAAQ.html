    <h1>How to detect the root cause of multiple failed logons</h1>
    <h2>Symptom</h2>

<p>Netwrix Auditor for Logon Activity may report a large amount of failed logons from a single workstation or server.</p>

<h2>Cause</h2>

<p>Usually, this happens because the problematic account credentials were saved somewhere on the target machine and became outdated. If a user&#39;s password had been changed but it was not updated in the system or application that had been using it, this systems/application will try to use the stored outdated credentials, therefore generating a large amount of failed logons.</p>

<h2>Reolution</h2>

<p>Login to the originating machine and check the following systems for outdated credentials:</p>

<ul><li><strong>Windows ?redential Manager </strong>- may store outdated credentials.</li><li><strong>Windows task scheduler </strong>- there could be a task configured to run using the problematic account.</li><li><strong>Application or service</strong> - there could be a service that is trying to start or a tool/application that is trying to run using outdated credentials.</li><li><strong>Terminal Server session</strong> - there could be an opened session with outdated credentials.</li><li><strong>AD Federation Services </strong>- replication issues - a new password was not replicated to ADFS.</li><li><strong>DCOM objects </strong>- sometimes a computer requires a restart after changing user password - to apply setting to DCOM objects that are using these credentials.</li></ul>

<p>Enter valid account credentials.<br><br>If you want an overview on how Failed Logon information is collected, check this article: <a href="https://kb.netwrix.com/5905" target="_blank">Why Do I Have Incomplete Information on Failed Logons?</a><br>If you need a guide on how to Investigate Failed Logon, check this article: <a href="https://kb.netwrix.com/5198" target="_blank">Investigating Failed Logons</a></p>
