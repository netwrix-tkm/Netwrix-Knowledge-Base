    <h1>System Changed Client Operating System</h1>
    <h2>Question</h2>

<div>
<p>Why were changes to Operating System, Operating System Version or Operating System Service Pack attributes reported as made by System?</p>
</div>

<h2>Answer</h2>

<div>
<p>This behavior is expected. Changes to the Operating System, Operating System Version and Operating System Service Pack attributes are reported as made by System due to the Active Directory architecture. Active Directory represented by System relies on individual computer accounts to update these attributes on each computer restart.</p>

<ul><li>
	<p>Active Directory receives the Operating System Version attribute data during the communication with a client. This data is then stored in the Active Directory client account. Once local changes occur, the client operating system relays new data to Active Directory.</p>
	</li></ul>

<p>If these attributes were changed manually, Netwrix Auditor will report the corresponding user account that introduced these changes.</p>
</div>

<div>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="color: #2980b9;"><strong>NOTE: </strong></span> Once you restart the client with changed attributes, Active Directory represented by System will modify these attributes to be reported by System.</p>
