<p>One of the following error messages under Event ID 1259 is prompted in Health Log for your SharePoint monitoring plan:</p>

<ol><li>
	<p>Error #1 ? <code>Unable to verify if SharePoint audit was configured correctly due to the following error: There was no endpoint listening at %Central_Administration_URL%/_vti_bin/Netwrix/ConfigurationService.svc that could accept the message. This is often caused by an incorrect address or SOAP action. See InnerException, if present, for more details.</code></p>
	</li><li>
	<p>Error #2 ? <code>Unable to verify if SharePoint audit was configured correctly due to the following error: A network-related or instance-specific error occurred while establishing a connection to SQL Server. The server was not found or was not accessible. Verify that the instance name is correct and that SQL Server is configured to allow remote connections. (provider: TCP Provider, error: 0 - No connection could be made because the target machine actively refused it.)</code></p>
	</li><li>
	<p>Error #3 ? <code>Unable to verify if SharePoint audit was configured correctly due to the following error: Cannot open database &quot;SharePoint_Config&quot; requested by the login. The login failed. Login failed for user &#39;username&#39;.</code></p>
	</li><li>
	<p>Error #4 ? <code>Unable to verify if SharePoint audit was configured correctly due to the following error: &quot;The request channel timed out while waiting for a reply after 01:00:00. Increase the timeout value passed to the call to Request or increase the SendTimeout value on the Binding. The time allotted to this operation may have been a portion of a longer timeout.</code></p>
