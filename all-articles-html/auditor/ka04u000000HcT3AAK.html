Error in _VMware inventory data collection: Error saving current VMware Virtual Center snapshot: The underlying connection was closed: An unexpected error occurred on a send.</span>

<div>This issue occurs due to increased security of the cipher strengths which are, by default, used by the VMware Management Web Services components. Due to this change that was introduced in vSphere 5.1, the host operating system is required to support a higher cipher strength to be able to connect to these components.</div>
<div></div>
<div>In Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008, the proper cipher strengths are built into the operating system. However, for older Windows operating systems, a Microsoft hotfix must be applied to add the supported cipher strengths.</div>

<hr></hr>

In order to resolve this issue the following <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/948963/en-us" target="_blank">Microsoft hot-fix</a> should be installed.

NOTE: This hot-fix is available only for Windows 2003 (32-bit and 64-bit Edition)  and it is <u><strong>NOT</strong></u><u><strong> AVAILABLE</strong></u> for Windows XP.
