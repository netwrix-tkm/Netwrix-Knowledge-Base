    <h1>Security Groups are Not Fully Displayed in the Azure AD Accounts � Attributes Report</h1>
    <h2>Question</h2>

<div>
<p>Why does the <b>Azure AD Accounts � Attributes</b> report show security groups membership (the <b>Member of</b> attribute) for an account in the format <strong>XXX and more</strong> instead of the full groups list?</p>
</div>

<h2>Answer</h2>

<div>
<p>In short, the answer is lack of space on the report page. Since there are a lot of groups those users are members of, the report does not have enough space to show all of them.</p>

<p>However, as an alternative, you can use the <b>Azure AD Accounts - Effective Group Membership</b> report along with the <b>Azure AD Accounts � Attributes</b> reports.</p>

<p>The thing is that when you click the <strong>Expand Group Membership</strong> link in the <b>Azure AD Accounts - Attributes</b> report, it basically redirects you to the information from the <b>Azure AD Accounts - Effective Group Membership</b> report.</p>

<p>Therefore, by using both reports simultaneously, we will be able to check the effective group membership information from the other report (<strong>Azure AD Accounts - Effective Group Membership</strong>) which would have the full list of the groups an account is a member of.</p>
