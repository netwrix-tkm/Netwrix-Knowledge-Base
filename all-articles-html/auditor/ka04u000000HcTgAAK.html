    <h1>Data gathering task has not been scheduled</h1>
    The status of your collections show as Not Scheduled after creation.  Following the instructions in the description does not help.

<hr></hr>

Something is blocking the creation of the Windows Scheduled Task.  This could be permissions of some kind, group policy or UAC.

<hr></hr>

To ensure that the following KB will be helpful please verify the following:

1) There is a scheduled task created in the C:WindowsTasks folder however the Windows Task Scheduler GUI does not show this task.

Once that is confirmed please try the following.  After each step where a change was made, refresh Windows Task Scheduler to see if the task shows up.

1) Ensure the Data Processing Account is a local admin and/or disable UAC on the Netwrix Server.
2) Ensure that credentials that are entered in <strong>Settings -&gt; </strong><strong>Data Collection -&gt; Modify Button </strong>are not blank.
3) <strong>Right click </strong>each of your managed objects and for each one that is using <strong>custom credentials</strong> also make sure that those are not blank.
4) Ensure that the following <strong>Group Policy</strong> is not applied to the Netwrix server -<strong> Network access: Do not allow storage of passwords and credentials for network authentication</strong>.  You can see if it is by opening <strong>Local Security Policy</strong> and navigating to <strong>Security Settings -&gt; Local Policies -&gt; Security Option</strong>s.

Note #2 and #3 are more likely to occur after a migration as the credentials are encrypted specifically for the original computer and need to be entered manually.
