    <h1>Netwrix Auditor Licensing FAQs</h1>
    <h2>What Is the Netwrix Auditor Licensing Model?</h2>
<p>By default, Auditor applications are licensed based on subscription. A subscription license enables you to use Auditor for a certain period. The subscription is purchased on a monthly or yearly basis, and it includes product updates and technical support.</p>
<h2>What License Counts Are Used in Netwrix Auditor Licenses?</h2>
<p>Most Auditor applications are licensed per enabled AD user. Review the table below for more information:</p>
<table border="1" style="width: 100%;max-width: 700px;"><tbody><tr><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Applications</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">License Counter</th></tr><tr><td colspan="2" rowspan="1" style="text-align: center;"><strong>On-Premises</strong></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Auditor for Active Directory</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Per enabled AD user</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Auditor for EMC</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Per enabled AD user</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Auditor for NetApp</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Per enabled AD user</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Auditor for Network Devices</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Per device</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Auditor for Nutanix Files</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Per enabled AD user</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Auditor for Oracle Database</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Per processor</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Auditor for SQL Server</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Per enabled AD user</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Auditor for VMware</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Per enabled AD user</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Auditor for Windows File Servers</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Per enabled AD user</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Auditor for Qumulo File Servers</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Per enabled AD user</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Auditor for Synology File Servers</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Per enabled AD user</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Auditor for Windows Server</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Per enabled AD user<br><i>or</i><br>Per server</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Auditor for Access Reviews</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Per enabled AD user</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" rowspan="1" style="text-align: center;"><strong>Cloud</strong></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Auditor for Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Per enabled Microsoft Entra ID user</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" rowspan="1" style="text-align: center;"><strong>Hybrid Licenses</strong></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Auditor for Exchange</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Per enabled user mailbox on-premises and in the cloud</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Auditor for SharePoint</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Per enabled Microsoft Entra ID user</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Auditor for MS Teams</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Per enabled Microsoft Entra ID user</td></tr></tbody></table>
<h2>How Can I Count Enabled AD Users?</h2>
<p>To count the number of licenses, you should provide the number of <strong>enabled AD user accounts</strong>, that is, calculate the number of your Active Directory user accounts in the <i>Enabled</i> state. Follow the instructions provided in this Auditor Knowledge Base article: <a href="https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/z-kb-articles-salesforce/page/kA00g000000H9UdCAK.html" target="_blank">How to Determine the Number of Enabled User Accounts for Auditor</a>. Then round up the calculation result to reserve some space for growth and to prevent scalability issues. For example:</p>
<ul><li>If the calculation script returns 214, round up this value to 220 when applying for the license.</li><li>If the calculation script returns 1841, round up this value to 2000 when applying for the license.</li></ul>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="Caution"><strong>IMPORTANT: </strong></span></p>
<ul><li>Service accounts are also counted. The accounts under which the services run in your infrastructure are included in the license count and, eventually, in the cost of a license.</li><li>Deleted, disabled, group, or computer accounts are not included in the license count.</li><li>You can use either <code class="lang-Registry">Omitallowedpathlist</code> omit list to reduce user count by omitting certain OUs from being audited or specify omitted OUs in the Auditor UI. You will not gain any information from these OUs; however, the amount of licenses will be reduced. For additional information on reducing the user count via Auditor UI, refer to the following article: <a href="https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/z-kb-articles-salesforce/page/kA04u000000PoL7CAK.html" target="_blank">Reducing the Used License Count</a>.

<h2>What Should I Provide for Netwrix Auditor for Oracle Database Licensing?</h2>
<p>The licensing for Auditor for Oracle Database is based on the number of processor licenses utilized by the entire Oracle Database deployment, that is, the number of processor licenses you purchased from Oracle.<br>Oracle defines the number of processor licenses as follows:<br><i>�The number of required licenses shall be determined by multiplying the total number of cores of the processor by a core processor licensing factor specified on the Oracle Processor Core Factor Table.�</i><br>If you are unsure how many Oracle processor licenses you have, check your processor type, find the corresponding factor in the <a href="http://www.oracle.com/us/corporate/contracts/processor-core-factor-table-070634.pdf" target="_blank">Oracle Processor Core Factor Table ? Oracle &#129125;</a>, and multiply it by the number of CPU cores on your Oracle Database deployment.<br>To obtain the <strong>number of CPU cores</strong>, go to the <a href="https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/z-kb-articles-salesforce/page/kA00g000000H9V9CAK.html" target="_blank">How to Count Number of CPU Cores on Your Oracle Database Deployment</a> article.</p>
<h2>What Should I Provide for Netwrix Auditor for Windows Server Licensing?</h2>
<p>Auditor for Windows Server is licensed either by the number of enabled AD users or the total number of virtual and physical servers.<br>Refer to the questions above for more information on how to count the number of AD accounts in the <i>Enabled</i> state.<br>For per-server licensing, count and provide the total number of the servers (physical or virtual) you are going to monitor with Auditor.</p>
<h2>What Should I Provide for Netwrix Auditor for Microsoft Entra ID Licensing?</h2>
<p>You should provide the number of <strong>enabled Microsoft Entra ID user accounts</strong>. Starting from version 9.96, guest/external users are not included in the license count. Follow the instructions outlined in the <a href="https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/z-kb-articles-salesforce/page/kA00g000000H9dyCAC.html" target="_blank">How to Determine the Count of Enabled Microsoft Entra ID Accounts</a> article.</p>
<p>You can use <code class="lang-Registry">omitUPNlist.txt</code> omit list to reduce user count by omitting certain user UPNs from being audited. You will not gain any information on these users; however, the amount of licenses will be reduced. For additional information on reducing the user count via Auditor UI, refer to the following article: <a href="https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/z-kb-articles-salesforce/page/kA04u000000PoL7CAK.html" target="_blank">Reducing the Used License Count</a>. For additional information on omit lists, refer to the following article: <a href="https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/z-kb-articles-salesforce/page/kA00g000000H9eeCAC.html" target="_blank">How to Use Omit Lists</a>.</p>
<h2>What Should I Provide for Netwrix Auditor for Exchange Licensing?</h2>
<p>For the Exchange data source, Auditor offers a convenient hybrid pricing model specifically designed for prospects with a hybrid Exchange (on-premises Exchange Server and Exchange Online) deployment. You can also have an on-premises-only or a cloud-only Exchange environment.<br>To get a hybrid Exchange license, you need to provide the <strong>total number of user mailboxes, both on-premises and online</strong>.<br>For example, if you have 200 online mailboxes and 300 on-premises Exchange mailboxes, you need to purchase a license for 500 mailboxes.<br>To calculate the number of user mailboxes used in your Microsoft Office 365 tenants, refer to the guidelines presented in the article titled <a href="https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/z-kb-articles-salesforce/page/kA00g000000H9T4CAK.html" target="_blank">How to Count Number of Licenses Required for Auditing a Microsoft Office 365 Tenant</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="Caution"><strong>IMPORTANT: </strong></span>A <strong>user mailbox</strong> can be a personal mailbox, an Online Archive mailbox, or both. Shared and resource mailboxes do not count. For example, if an Exchange Online user has one personal mailbox and one Online Archive mailbox, this user will be counted as a single licensed object. If a user has no Online Archive mailbox but three personal mailboxes, this will be counted as three licensed objects.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>What Should I Provide for Netwrix Auditor for SharePoint Licensing?</h2>
<p>For the SharePoint data source, Auditor offers a convenient hybrid pricing model specifically designed for prospects with a hybrid SharePoint (on-premises SharePoint and SharePoint Online) deployment. You can also have an on-premises-only or a cloud-only SharePoint environment.<br>To get a hybrid SharePoint license, you need to provide the <strong>total number of AD users</strong> (both enabled AD users on-premises and cloud-only Microsoft Entra ID users).<br>For example, if you have 450 enabled on-premises AD users and 50 active Microsoft Entra ID users, you need to purchase a license for 500 users.</p>
<h2>I�m Auditing SQL Servers Only, and the Licenses Window Shows That the License Was Exceeded Not Only for the SQL Server but Also for Active Directory and Others. Why?</h2>
<p>When Auditor is running, the number of <strong>enabled AD user accounts</strong> (license count that applies to the corresponding monitoring areas) is refreshed by the Auditor component responsible for AD data collection. If this count is exceeded, your SQL Server audit gets out of compliance with the existing license. Moreover, you have no opportunity to start auditing any other data source that depends on this count (for example, VMware or Windows Server).</p>
<h2>How Can I Obtain a License?</h2>
<p>To obtain a proper license for your infrastructure, you should provide the corresponding counts to Netwrix. Then you will receive the license key to address your auditing needs, based on the numbers you provided.<br>For evaluation purposes, you can use a free trial version of Auditor that has a bundled trial license.</p>
<h4>To update or add a license in Auditor Console:</h4>
<ol><li>Go to <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Licenses</strong> and click <strong>Update</strong>.</li><li>In the dialog that opens, do one of the following:
<ul><li>Select <strong>Load from file</strong>, click <strong>Browse</strong>, and point to a license file received from your sales representative.</li><li>Select <strong>Enter manually</strong> and type in your company name, license count, and license codes.</li></ul>
</li></ol>
<p>To request more licensing information, please contact <a href="mailto:licensing@netwrix.com" target="_blank">licensing@netwrix.com</a>.</p>
<h2>What Is Displayed in the License Window of the Product UI?</h2>
<p>You can use the <strong>Licenses</strong> window to review the status of your current licenses, update them, and add new licenses.<br>On the Auditor main screen, click the <strong>Settings</strong> tile and then select <strong>Licenses</strong>. The window will look as shown below.</p>
<p><img alt="Licenses window in Auditor UI showing license status and counts" height="291" src="https://nwxcorp.file.force.com/servlet/rtaImage?eid=ka0Qk000000DbzR&amp;feoid=00N0g000004CA0p&amp;refid=0EM4u000002PbUM" width="500"></img><br>Here:</p>
<ul><li>The <strong>Total count</strong> field shows how many licensed objects (enabled AD users, processors, or mailboxes) are included in your current license. This number is displayed for each licensed monitoring area. If you are running a trial version, this field will show �Unlimited� for all data sources.</li><li>The <strong>Used licenses</strong> field shows the number of licensed objects counted at the moment.</li></ul>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="Note"><strong>NOTE: </strong></span>The number of used licenses is displayed only in the cells that correspond to the baseline data sources: Active Directory (and Microsoft Entra ID), Exchange, and Network Devices.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>How Do I Remove License Information for an Unused Application?</h2>
<p>You may choose to no longer audit a data source, and thus not renew the license for the corresponding application. Unused licenses do not need to be removed from Auditor, with the exception of one special case. This case is upgrading an Auditor installation that has some expired licenses. Most recent (9.95 and up) versions of Auditor allow you to remove a license directly from the user interface. If you have an older version of Auditor and need to remove an expired license as it blocks your upgrade, contact Netwrix Technical Support.</p>
