    <h1>Object Deletion does not show up in alerts and reports when running Netwrix Auditor under non-admin account</h1>
    You are running Netwrix Auditor under non-admin account in DCs with Windows 2000 and Windows Server 2003 and object deletion does not show up in reports and alerts.

<hr></hr>

When an Active Directory object is deleted, its image stays in the Deleted Objects container for a specified time. Due to this feature other domain controllers that are replicating changes become aware of the deletion. By default, only System account and members of Administrators group can view the contents of this container.

This article describes how to modify the permissions on the deleted objects container.

You may have to modify permissions on the Deleted Objects container if the following conditions are true:
<ul><li>You have enterprise applications or services that bind to Active Directory with a non-System account or a non-Administrator account</li><li>These enterprise applications or services poll directory for  changes</li></ul>

<hr></hr>

To modify permissions on the Deleted Objects container so that non-administrators can view this container, use the <strong>DSACLS.exe</strong> program. The DSACLS.exe program is included in Active Directory Application Mode (ADAM) Administration Tools.

To obtain and install the <strong>ADAM Administration Tools</strong>, perform the following steps:
<ol><li>Download the ADAM retail package. This file is available for download from the Microsoft Download Center, please follow this link : <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=9688F8B9-1034-4EF6-A3E5-2A2A57B5C8E4&amp;displaylang=en" target="_blank">http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=9688F8B9-1034-4EF6-A3E5-2A2A57B5C8E4&amp;displaylang=en</a>;
<strong>Note:</strong> This version of the ADAM Administration Tools is an upgrade from the version in the Windows Server 2003 Support Tools. This version of the ADAM Administration Tools is supported by Microsoft Windows Server 2003, Standard Edition; Microsoft Windows Server 2003, Enterprise Edition; Microsoft Windows Server 2003, Datacenter Edition; and Microsoft Windows XP Professional. On Microsoft Windows Server 2008 this tool is already installed.</li><li>Double-click <strong>Adamsetup.exe</strong> program to start the Active Directory Application Mode Setup Wizard.</li><li>Select ADAM administration tools only, and then click Next.</li><li>Proceed with the wizard.</li></ol>
After you have installed the <strong>ADAM Administration Tools</strong>, you can modify the permissions on the deleted objects container. To do this, perform the following steps:
<ol><li>Log on with a user account that is a member of the <strong>Domain Admins</strong> group.</li><li>Click <strong>Start -&gt; All Programms -&gt; ADAM</strong> and then click <strong>ADAM Tools Command Prompt.</strong></li><li>At the command prompt, type a command similar to the following example:
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong><em>dsacls &quot;CN=Deleted Objects,DC=Contoso,DC=com&quot; /takeownership</em></strong>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>Note:</strong></div>
<ul><li style="margin-left: 40px;">When you type this command, use the name of the deleted objects container for your domain.</li><li style="margin-left: 40px;">Each domain in the forest will have its own deleted objects container.</li></ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">

Output that is similar to the following example should be displayed:
<div></div>

</div></li><li>To grant a security principal permission to view the objects in the deleted objects container, type a command that is similar to the following example:

<div><strong>Explanation: </strong>In this example, the user &quot;<strong>CONTOSOEricLang</strong>&quot; has been granted List Contents and Read Property permissions on the deleted objects container in the &quot;<strong>CONTOSO</strong>&quot; domain. These permissions let this user view the contents of the deleted objects container, but do not let this user make any changes to objects in the container. These permissions are equivalent to the default permissions that are granted to the Administrators group. By default, only the System account has permission to modify objects in the deleted objects container.</div></li></ol>
