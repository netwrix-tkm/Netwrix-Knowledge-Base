    <h1>Active Directory Changes Duplicated in Reports with System and Unknown in WHO and WHERE Fields</h1>
    <h2>Question</h2>

<div>
<p>Why were some Active Directory changes duplicated with System and Unknown in <strong>WHO</strong> and <strong>WHERE</strong> fields correspondingly?</p>
</div>

<h2>Answer</h2>

<div>
<p>Active Directory reports may contain a change and its duplicate with System in the <strong>WHO</strong> field and Unknown in the <strong>WHERE</strong> field. This behavior is expected due to the DirSync control design.<br>During data collection, Netwrix Auditor collects changes via DirSync control through the same domain controller each time. If the domain controller is unavailable at the time of data collection, Netwrix Auditor switches to another domain controller. Data collected from the new domain controller may include changes reported by the previous domain controller.<br><br>You can verify this behavior ï¿½ follow the <code>%Working Folder%\AD Change Reporter\Omitlists\%YOUR_DOMAIN%</code> path to open dirsyncdclist.txt in any text editor. If this file contains more than one domain controller, the DCs listed in the file were not always available for data collection.<br>You can delete the dirsyncdclist.txt file. During the next data collection Netwrix Auditor will connect to the first available comain controller and recreate the dirsyncdclist.txt file to contain the new domain controller.</p>
