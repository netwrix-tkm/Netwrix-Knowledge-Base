    <h1>Upgrade Increments for Netwrix Auditor</h1>
    <h2>Overview</h2>
<p>When upgrading from old versions of Netwrix Auditor, you must do that�<strong>incrementally</strong>. Below is the list of approved upgrade paths up to the version 10.5.</p>
<h2>Before you start</h2>
<p>To successfully access the download packages, ensure you are logged in with your customer portal account at <a href="https://www.netwrix.com/my_account.html" target="_blank">Netwrix.com</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>IMPORTANT: </strong></span>Make sure the free disk space in your SQL server totals to at least 30% of the total size of all Netwrix Auditor-related databases. This will allow for the database growth during the upgrade.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Upgrade Recommendations</h2>
<h4>For versions older than 9.5</h4>
<ul><li><strong>Upgrading from versions older than 9.5�is not recommended!</strong>�Incremental upgrades may cause error accumulation and cause issues with the product stability post-upgrade. Best practices recommend that you leave your Netwrix Auditor as is for historical reports and start a new server with the latest version installed. Proceed only if you absolutely have to.</li><li>Make sure to wait at least 24 hours before upgrading to the next version, so that the product has enough time time upgrade your databases.</li><li>Contact Technical Support for download links for Netwrix Auditor 8.5 and 9.5</li><li>Once 8.5 is installed, you will need to run the upgrade of your Audit Databases manually. To do this, launch Netwrix Auditor Administrator Console, navigate to <strong>Audit Archive�</strong>&gt; <strong>Audit Database</strong> and then click <strong>Upgrade</strong>.</li></ul>
<h4>For Versions 9.5 and Newer</h4>
<ul><li>
<p>Upgrading to Auditor�v10.6 requires .NET 4.8 on the Auditor server and on any servers included in a Windows Server or User Activity Monitoring Plan that have the Compression Service enabled.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="Caution"><strong>IMPORTANT: </strong></span>Plan your upgrade carefully. .NET 4.8 requires Windows Server 2016 or later and may require a server reboot after installation.</p>
</blockquote>
</li><li>
<p>Starting from the version 9.9 Netwrix implemented the new license format. To reissue the license:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>If you upgrade incrementally, just follow steps given in the <strong>Upgrade Paths</strong> table below, and your license will upgrade automatically.</p>
</li><li>
<p>If you leave your Netwrix Auditor as is and start a new server with the latest version, contact your Account Manager and request the newly formatted license.</p>
</li></ul>
</li><li>Do not pause the upgrade chain in the middle for a long time as this may leave your system in a vulnerable state. The latest product version includes all functionality from the previous versions, adds new features and includes important security updates.</li><li>After each�incremental update, you must wait for the DBs to be upgraded. In large/busy environments, this may take up to�24 hours. Check the Health Log to see if database was upgraded successfully. Event IDs <b>4410 </b>and <b>4405 </b>indicate that upgrade was done successfully, any other 44XX Event IDs indicate that there was an error.</li><li>If you have the capability to capture a snapshot of the server, we recommend doing so. Before we begin, launch a PowerShell session as Administrator and execute the following command:</li></ul>
<pre class="ckeditor_codeblock">Stop-Service -Displayname Netwrix*</pre>
<p>This will stop all Netwrix Services and prevent complications during the upgrade.</p>
