    <h1>How to Configure User Activity to Trigger a Recording Session on Program Execution</h1>
    How to configure User Activity to start recording when a particular program is launched?
<hr></hr> Netwrix Auditor for User Activity offers three options:<br>1) Record when any application is run.<br>2) Record when a specific application is run.<br>3) Record when any application is run except the ones specified.<br><br>This article addresses #2 and #3 specifically as the way in which the application names are entered is the same for both. Note: It is required that the program has a window with a title. For example programs executed via command line without a GUI would not apply.<br><br>There are two ways to find the application description:
<ol><li>Launch the application you want to monitor and start Task Manager. In the Task Manager dialog, open the <strong>Processes</strong> tab and look for the application description in the <strong>Description</strong> column.</li><li>Locate the executable file for the application you want to monitor, right-click it and select <strong>Properties</strong>. In the <strong>Properties</strong> dialog, switch to the <strong>Details</strong> tab and look for the application description in the <strong>File Description </strong>field.</li></ol>
Note: Although the video recording will only start when a particular application is opened, it still records the entire screen.<br><strong>Example:</strong> If you want to configure to record each time Notepad is open you would use <em>Notepad</em> as the Application Description and for the Window Title you can use something like *Notepad* as the word &quot;Notepad&quot; is always in the Window Title regardless of the name of the document open.
