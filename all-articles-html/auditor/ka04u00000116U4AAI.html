    <h1>System Changed Service Principle Name Attribute</h1>
    <h2>Question</h2>

<div>
<p>Why was a Service Principle Name attribute change reported as made by System or a user account?</p>
</div>

<h2>Answer</h2>

<div>
<p>A Kerberos Service Principle Name attribute allows a service on a specific server to be associated with an account responsible for management of the service. Once associated, a mutual Kerberos authentication is permitted. Changes to this attribute are usually made by System in response to the operating system changes on a specific computer, e.g. installation of operating system updates, name changes, installation of SQL Server, etc.<br>The WHO field for changes related to the Service Principle Name attribute may contain the following:</p>

<ul><li>
	<p>Made by a computer account with $ prefix (<strong>DOMAINXVISIO$</strong>) � the Service Principle Name attribute was changed by a local system service of the computer.</p>
	</li><li>
	<p>Made by a domain controller account with $ prefix (<strong>DOMAINXPTDC$</strong>) � the Service Principle Name attribute was changed by a local system service on the domain controller.</p>
	</li><li>
	<p>Made by the <strong>System</strong> account � the Service Principle Name attribute was changed by Active Directory represented by System in response to the operating system changes on computer, but the corresponding security event wasn&#39;t generated for this system change.</p>
	</li><li>
	<p>Made by an actual user account � the Service Principle Name attribute was modified manually.</p>
	</li></ul>

<p>Since the Service Principle Name attribute is changed only for system purpose, you can exclude this attribute from the monitoring scope:</p>

<ul><li>
	<p>In %Netwrix Auditor installation folder%\Active Directory Auditing, add the following line to the omitproplist.txt file:</p>

	<pre class="has-inner-focus">
*.ServicePrincipleName</pre>
	</li><li>
	<p>In the same folder, remove the following line from the unomitproplist.txt file:</p>

	<pre class="has-inner-focus">
*.ServicePrincipleName</pre>
	</li></ul>
