<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>This article provides a summary of the permissions required to facilitate normal backup and recovery operations in an Active Directory environment. It also outlines the behavior and limitations of the DirSync control when used for synchronization tasks.</p>
<h2>Required Permissions for Backup and Recovery</h2>
<p>To perform backup and recovery operations in an Active Directory environment, specific permissions are required. These permissions are typically available to members of the <strong>Domain Administrators</strong> security group. Below is a detailed breakdown of the necessary permissions for different Active Directory containers and objects:</p>
<h4>1. Schema Container</h4>
<p>Membership in the <strong>Schema Admins</strong> group is required to back up objects within the domain's Schema Container.</p>
<h4>2. Default Naming Context</h4>
<p>The following permissions are necessary to back up and roll back Active Directory objects within the domain's default naming context:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>ALLOW</strong> – Write Property right (SelfAndChildren)</li>
<li><strong>ALLOW</strong> – Create Child right (SelfAndChildren)</li>
<li><strong>ALLOW</strong> – Replicating Directory Changes extended right (SelfAndChildren)</li>
<li><strong>ALLOW</strong> – Reanimate Tombstones extended right (SelfAndChildren)</li>
</ul>
<h4>3. DomainDnsZones and ForestDnsZones Partitions</h4>
<p>To back up and roll back Active Directory DNS objects, the following permissions are required:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>ALLOW</strong> – Write Property right (SelfAndChildren)</li>
<li><strong>ALLOW</strong> – Create Child right (SelfAndChildren)</li>
<li><strong>ALLOW</strong> – Replicating Directory Changes extended right (SelfAndChildren)</li>
<li><strong>ALLOW</strong> – Reanimate Tombstones extended right (SelfAndChildren)</li>
</ul>
<h4>4. Sites Container</h4>
<p>The following permissions are necessary to back up and roll back Active Directory Sites and Services objects:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>ALLOW</strong> – Generic Read right (SelfAndChildren)</li>
<li><strong>ALLOW</strong> – Generic Write right (SelfAndChildren)</li>
<li><strong>ALLOW</strong> – Create Child right (SelfAndChildren)</li>
<li><strong>ALLOW</strong> – Replicating Directory Changes extended right (SelfAndChildren)</li>
<li><strong>ALLOW</strong> – Reanimate Tombstones extended right (SelfAndChildren)</li>
</ul>
<h4>5. Group Policy Objects</h4>
<p>The following Group Policy access rights are required to back up and roll back Group Policy Objects:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>READ</strong></li>
<li><strong>WRITE</strong></li>
<li><strong>CREATE CHILD OBJECT</strong></li>
<li><strong>DELETE CHILD OBJECT</strong></li>
<li><strong>DELETE</strong></li>
<li><strong>MODIFY PERMISSIONS</strong></li>
<li><strong>MODIFY OWNER</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><span class="Caution"><strong>IMPORTANT: </strong></span>Additional permissions may be necessary to allow recovery operations to function properly in your organization’s environment. Ensure that all required permissions are granted before proceeding with backup or recovery tasks.</p>

<h2>DirSync Control Behavior and Limitations</h2>
<p>The DirSync control is a tool used to synchronize changes in Active Directory. Below are its key behaviors and limitations:</p>
<h4>1. Change Detection</h4>
<p>A DirSync control search returns all changes made to an Active Directory object, including deleted objects, provided the user account has the <strong>Replicating Directory Changes</strong> permission on the domain naming context.</p>
<h4>2. Object Movement and Renaming</h4>
<p>When an object is renamed or moved, its child objects are not included in the results of a DirSync control search, even if their distinguished names have changed.</p>
<h4>3. Security Descriptor Changes</h4>
<p>Changes to an inheritable access control entry (ACE) in an object’s security descriptor are not reflected in the results for child objects, even if their security descriptors have changed.</p>
<h4>4. Deleted Objects</h4>
<p>Deleted objects that match the specified search filter are automatically included in the results. However, changes made during the deletion process may affect the search filter's ability to return the object.</p>
<h4>5. Domain Controller Replication</h4>
<p>The results of a DirSync control search reflect the state of objects on the targeted domain controller (DC) at the time of the search. Changes made on other DCs will not be included if they have not yet been replicated to the target DC.</p>
<h4>6. Cookie Usage</h4>
<p>Microsoft recommends binding to the same DC that generated the DirSync cookie being used. If the same DC is unavailable, either wait for it to become available or bind to a new DC and perform a full synchronization.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="Note"><strong>NOTE: </strong></span>A cookie generated by one DC can be passed to a different DC hosting a replica of the same directory partition without missing changes. However, replication latency may result in duplicate or full synchronization results.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>7. Search Scope</h4>
<p>A DirSync control search cannot be confined to a specific area of Active Directory. All changes made to an Active Directory partition are returned, which may include unwanted object data.</p>
