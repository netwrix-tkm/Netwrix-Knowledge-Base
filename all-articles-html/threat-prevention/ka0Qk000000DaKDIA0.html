    <h1>Threat Prevention Security Best Practices</h1>
    <p>Because of its purpose and capabilities, Threat Prevention should be operated at the same security level as the domain controllers it protects. This collection of best practices is intended to supplement customers&#39; own security judgement and highlight risks and recommendations.</p>

<table><thead><tr><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Best Practice</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Priority</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Restrict access to the Threat Prevention application server</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">High</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Individuals with administrative access to the Threat Prevention server are implicitly administrators of Threat Prevention and through its capabilities may be able to become administrators on domain controllers. Limit access to the least possible.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Operate Threat Prevention at the same security level as you operate domain controllers</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">High</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">This one principle should guide decisions made about the management and operation of Threat Prevention. Because Threat Prevention protects domain controllers, its implementation should be as protected as they are. Consider deploying Threat Prevention within the same credential boundary as domain controllers to limit the potential for privilege escalation.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Protect Threat Prevention&#39;s SQL Server operating system and databases</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">High</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">StealthNTERCEPT&#39;s SQL Server database contains sensitive configuration data. The same controls applied to the Threat Prevention server should be applied to the SQL server as well.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Use the Protected Users group to secure accounts that login to the Threat Prevention server</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Medium</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Adding users to the Protected Users group in active directory automatically protects the account by forcing it to only use secure authentication techniques</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Periodically review Threat Prevention console permissions</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Medium</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Periodically review holders of the Threat Prevention Administrators and Console Operators roles to ensure only authorized individuals hold those roles.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Protect, randomize, and periodically rotate Windows local administrator account passwords</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Medium</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Local administrator credentials are frequently targeted by attackers, whether through password guessing or pass-the-hash attacks. Ensure these credentials are randomized, stored securely, and periodically changed using a solution like Microsoft LAPS.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Ensure Microsoft security updates are applied to the Threat Prevention server</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Medium</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Rapidly applying Windows security updates is essential to protecting the Threat Prevention server from the exploitation of known vulnerabilities.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Install and regularly update antivirus and endpoint protection products</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Medium</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Antivirus and endpoint detection and response solutions help protect servers and applications from malware and adversarial techniques. Install your standard solutions and ensure they are regularly updated.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Install only required applications on the Threat Prevention server</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Medium</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Installing unnecessary software on the Threat Prevention server increases its attack surface and the amount of threats that must be defended against. Only install absolutely necessary software.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Ensure only server administrators can access the Threat Prevention installation directory</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Medium</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">By default, Threat Prevention uses the permissions granted to program files which only allows SYSTEM, Administrators and, when windows authentication is used, the service account will be applied directly with full control and other accounts. Granting additional privileges creates additional risks to Threat Prevention and should be avoided.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Use a Privileged Access Management (PAM) solution to protect administrative access to Threat Prevention</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Medium</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">A PAM solution allows administrators to securely connect to Threat Prevention and can provide an audit trail for activities taken on the server and within the product.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Ensure Network Level Authentication (NLA) is enabled on the Threat Prevention server</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Low</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Network Level Authentication improves the security of the Remote Desktop Protocol connection used to administer the Threat Prevention server.</td></tr></tbody></table>
