    <h1>Strong proxy affinity host selection may leave hosts in queue that could be scanned by other proxies</h1>
    <p><strong><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large">Summary:</span></strong> With strong proxy affinity, the host selection process selects hosts in alphabetical order for running. A pushed host gets added to the end of the queue as soon as the new &quot;host is not ready&quot; code is received.</p>
<p><strong><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large">Issue:</span></strong> With strong proxy affinity, the host selection process selects hosts in alphabetical order for running, via the following query.<br><br>SELECT HOST FROM [&#39;+TableNameTag+&#39;] &#39;+<br>� � � &#39;WHERE SA_HOST =&#39;&#39;&#39;+SAHostNameTag+&#39;&#39;&#39; &#39;+<br>� � � &#39;AND HOSTSTATUS NOT IN (&#39;&#39;Offline&#39;&#39;, &#39;&#39;Failed&#39;&#39;, &#39;&#39;Aborted&#39;&#39;) &#39;+<br>� � � &#39;GROUP BY HOST &#39;+<br>� � � &#39;ORDER BY MAX(JobRunTimeKey)<br><br>in the event that there are, say, 5 proxy servers and the job is set to no more than 10 threads per proxy, and the job threads are set to 50, with say 200 hosts in a host list........<br><br>if the hosts themselves in alphabetical order are all to the same proxy, the scan will not be as efficient as it could be. the result is that one proxy is utilizing all threads 10 threads, while 40 hosts are waiting for the same proxy to finish, and the remaining 4 proxies are not doing any work at all.<br>�</p>
<p><strong><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large">Instructions:</span></strong> A pushed host gets added to the end of the queue as soon as the new &quot;host is not ready&quot; code is received.�<br><br>Here are the change notes from dev:�<br><br>-Updated StealthAUDIT core and SA Job Engine so it accepts new return code &quot;host is not ready&quot; from Data collector and it pushes host to the end of the waiting queue.�<br>-Updated FSAA data collector so when Host is waiting for strong proxy server for certain period of time, DC collector will indicate SAJobEngine that current host is not ready so it should go back to waiting queue and take next host from waiting queue.�<br>-Added configurational option for &quot;Maximum waiting time for strong proxy affinity&quot; and default value is 5 mins.�<br><br>And some additional notes from QA:�<br><br>-Enhancement designed to work with FSAA Strong Proxy Affinity (target host will be always processed by same proxy server).�<br>-Allows for better utilization of job&#39;s worker threads. A proxy server that has all concurrent scan threads busy no longer keeps the job&#39;s hosts queue from moving ahead because the next host in line needs the busy proxy. Hosts waiting for a busy proxy are pushed back into the job engine queue (outside of worker threads) so other hosts that can use a free proxy can move ahead and be processed.�<br>-A new option was added to the Remote Data Collection Configuration: &#39;Maximum waiting time for strong proxy affinity&#39;: time that a host waits, while the proxy server is busy, before it gets pushed into the job engine queue.�</p>
