    <h1>The �User must change password at next logon&quot; option is enabled automatically</h1>
    When a user attempts to reset password and fails to provide a password which corresponds to the password policy, the &quot;User must change password at next logon&quot; option will be automatically enabled for this user.

<hr></hr>

Due to the way it works, Netwrix Password Manager cannot reset a password to a new value directly, because this procedure requires the user&#39;s current password, and the software does not know it. Therefore, the Password Manager first resets the password to a random one and only after that changes it to a new value. This two-step procedure is required because the Security Policies apply only during a password change, not a password reset operation. Therefore, it is not possible to select some of the password policies, for example, password history.

The issue is replicated with the following scenario:

1. &quot;Use AD password policy settings&quot; option is <strong>enabled</strong> in the <strong>Admin porta</strong>l -&gt; <strong>Domains</strong> -&gt; <strong>Edit </strong>Managed Domain.
2. A user performs a reset password operation. In Password Manager it&#39;s a 3-step procedure:
- password is reset to a random value
- new password is checked for AD password policy compliance
- if the new password does not pass the check, it stays random and &quot;user must change password at next logon&quot; option is enabled automatically

3. User fails to provide the password which complies with password policy. According to the previous step, the user&#39;s old password is no longer valid (was reset to random) and new password was not applied.

Similar behavior occurs during Change password procedure, but password is not get reset to a random one, so just &quot;User must change password at next logon&quot; checkbox gets enabled.

<hr></hr>

To prevent this issue, you can disable the &quot;<strong>Use AD password policy settings</strong>&quot; option (<strong>Admin Portal</strong> -&gt; <strong>Domains</strong>-&gt; <strong>Edit</strong>) and configure the password policy through Netwrix Password Manager (<strong>Admin Portal</strong> -&gt; <strong>Settings </strong>-&gt; <strong>Password Policy</strong> tab).
