    <h1>SPAA DC Resolves Blank SIDs by creating sequential SIDs (X-1-1, X-1-2,.X-1-387)</h1>
    <p><strong><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large">Summary:</span></strong> Customer noted that during an entitlement review in the AIC there were several users that had only a truncated SID value starting with the letter X and no other identifying information (x-1-837). Examples from the customer environment are shown in the attached screenshot.</p><p><strong><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large">Issue:</span></strong> Customer noticed during an entitlement review of his HR SharePoint site in SharePoint 2016 that there were several users who shown only as short SIDs beginning with the letter X (X-1-837) and wanted to know what these accounts were because they couldn&#39;t be searched for in in the main page of the AIC.</p><p><strong><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large">Instructions:</span></strong> It turns out that the objects were created by StealthAUDIT during the SPAA scan to represent local SharePoint objects that do not have SIDs associated with them. In this case they were objects that were associated to SharePoint Personal Sites for users who had been terminated. All other accounts were able to resolve because SPAA scans matched the username from the personal site owner to the samaccounname in ADI. The 3 objects that were unresolved had no details because those three users had been deleted from AD and the user is doing full AD scans daily so they could no longer be resolved to a user<br>ï¿½</p><p><strong><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large">Product:</span></strong> AIC<br><strong><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large">Module:</span></strong> AIC - Entitlement Review;SA - DC - SPAA - Permissions<br><strong><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large">Versions:</span></strong> All<br><strong><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large">Legacy Article ID:</span></strong> 2156<br></p>
