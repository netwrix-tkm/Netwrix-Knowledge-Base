    <h1>Setting up SAM to collect file activity from Hitachi NAS devices with multiple EVS logs</h1>
    <p><strong>Title:</strong> Setting up SAM to collect from Hitachi NAS devices with multiple EVS logs</p>
<p><strong>Channel:</strong>� Internal</p>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong> SAM only allows you to define one log file per NAS device monitored host, however Hitachi NAS devices can have multiple EVS storage locations for a single hostname. Each EVS requires the activity logfile to be set up separately.</p>

<p><strong>Issue:</strong> SAM (Stealthbits Activity Monitor) only allows you to define one log file per NAS device monitored host, however Hitachi NAS devices can have multiple EVS storage locations for a single hostname. Each EVS requires the activity logfile to be set up separately.</p>
<p>�</p>
<p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p>
<p>1. Configure log file settings for each Hitachi EVS.� �Hitachi NAS logs must be configured to be exposed via a UNC for SAM to read them.� �(Note that you also have to set up the actual auditing to be enabled on desired location once the logging is set up.� See the Stealthbits_SMP_FS_Hitachi_ConfigGuide.pdf document for more details, especially the section &quot;Hitachi Device Configuration for Activity Monitoring.)</p>
<p>NOTE: Be sure the log roll over policy is set to &quot;NEW&quot; logs instead of &quot;WRAP&quot;.� (SAM does not support wrapped log files for Hitachi, and the debug logs will show you an error if you configure it that way.� You activity collection will simply appear to stop when the log wraps.)</p>

<p>�</p>
<p>2. Deploy / choose your SAM agent that will be responsible for the Hitachi NAS activity collection.</p>
<p>�</p>
<p>3. Create a separate monitored host entry for *EACH* EVS!� It is recommended to name these monitored hosts for the EVS names so that you can easily identify them.� DO NOT USE THE HOSTNAME AS THE MONITORED HOST NAME.� �</p>

<p>�</p>
<p>4. Confirm you are receiving activity as expected for each EVS and you can see it in a SAM event search.� Note that the Hitachi NAS hostname will be the host in the search results, not the EVS name.� Be sure you can distinguish between EVS locations by the path when checking.� (NOTE: SAM will let you set up multiple monitored hosts with the same hostname, but you will likely be unable to see results from all of them in the search function.� This is one of multiple reasons we are setting up the monitor host with the EVS hostname.)</p>
<p>�</p>
<p>5. Edit the SAM configuration file SBTFileMon.ini.� (You may want to do this by opening notepad as an administrator, to prevent issues saving later.) The default location for this is on the agent machine in the directory C:\Program Files\Stealthbits\StealthAUDIT\FSAC.� This is a text file you can edit.� Each monitored host will have a section that begins with [HNAS_MONITOR1], [HNAS_MONITOR2), etc.� In EACH monitored host section, you will need to add the line ALT_HOST=youractualhostname.domain.com (put your Hitachi NAS machine name).� �This name is the name you will be using as a target host in StealthAUDIT&#39;s FSAC jobs later.)� You will need to add this line for EACH monitored host (each EVS).</p>

<p>Save the configuration file.� (If you have trouble saving or get an access denied error, save elsewhere and then copy the file over to replace the original manually.)</p>
<p>�</p>
<p>6. Disable and then Re-Enable each monitored host that is for an EVS.� (This is simply to ensure that our configuration file changes are read.)</p>
<p>7. Set up StealthAUDIT&#39;s FSAC job to collect the data as you would normally.� The target host is the Hitachi NAS server hostname, and the proxy server is the SAM agent hostname.� When you run the FSAC collection, it should collect all the data for the hostname you put into ALT_HOST in our configuration file from all the different EVS monitored hosts on the SAM agent.</p>
