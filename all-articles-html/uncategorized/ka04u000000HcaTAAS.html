    <h1>Historical Weak Passwords and Why They Are Important</h1>

<p>By default, Active Directory retains a user�s previous passwords to prevent them from being reused, if configured to do so. This is a configurable value within Group Policy, and it is recommended to keep the maximum configurable value of 24. StealthAUDIT is able to analyze user�s previous passwords stored in Active Directory the same way it can analyze the current password to determine if it is weak. Just like the current passwords, the hashes of the historical passwords are compared against the dictionary file leveraged by the job to determine if they were found in a breached password dictionary file. If a user is identified as having a Weak Historical Password, that can indicate a trend that the user is using commonly used passwords (e.g. Winter2021) or passwords that they share among other accounts that may have been breached. The exception by itself is not an indicator of exposure to a password spraying or brute force attack. If a user is to be found leveraging a Weak Historical password and a current Weak Password, they may be a good candidate for education on password hygiene and a forced reset. It is Stealthbits recommendation that users that have Weak Historical Passwords should be monitored for continued use of breached passwords to prevent future exposure.</p>
