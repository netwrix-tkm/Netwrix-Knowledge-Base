    <h1>Netwrix Software Authenticity and Integrity</h1>
    <p>As a software publisher, Netwrix takes its responsibility to provide you secure software products seriously. Before installing software that you&#39;ve obtained from the internet, you should verify its authenticity (that you obtained it from an authorized source) and its integrity (that it hasn&#39;t been modified). Netwrix employs multiple techniques to enable you to verify the authenticity and integrity of the software we publish.</p>
<h2>Authorized Sources of Netwrix Software</h2>
<p>Only software obtained from the sources detailed here is authentic.</p>
<ul><li>Software downloads are published to the�<a href="https://www.netwrix.com/my_products.html" target="_blank">Customer Portal</a>. Files downloaded from the Customer Portal will originate from the domain <i>releases.netwrix.com</i>.</li><li>Tools, examples, and other materials on�<a href="https://github.com/netwrix" target="_blank">github.com/netwrix</a>.</li></ul>
<h2>Verifying Software Authenticity</h2>
<p>Netwrix uses industry-standard code signing technologies to provide evidence of the authenticity and integrity of the software we publish. The following certificates are used:</p>
<ul><li>Windows binaries are signed with a code signing certificate issued to &quot;Netwrix Corporation&quot; with extended validation by Digicert. The certificate fingerprint is <code>80E18E3389CE740D3F124CC45D5CF83A55FD472A</code>.</li><li>Linux and UNIX packages (RPM, deb, etc.) are signed with the &quot;Netwrix Corporation (PGP Signing Key) &lt;productsecurity@netwrix.com&gt;&quot; PGP�key. The public key fingerprint is�<code>3F5EB22771A2BD66D1AA011A43E7B9B0AE7B49D8</code>�and can be obtained at�<a href="https://releases.netwrix.com/netwrixcorporation-pgp-signing.asc" target="_blank">https://releases.netwrix.com/netwrixcorporation-pgp-signing.asc</a>.</li></ul>
<h2>Verifying Software Integrity</h2>
<p>In addition to signing our releases, Netwrix publishes cryptographic hashes for each download. A file containing the hash can be downloaded from the Customer Portal by clicking the�<img alt="User-added image" src="https://nwxcorp.file.force.com/servlet/rtaImage?eid=ka0Qk000000Ctn7&amp;feoid=00N0g000004CA0p&amp;refid=0EM4u000008LiI7"></img>�icon next to each download. To protect from unauthorized modification, these files are signed with the &quot;Netwrix Corporation (PGP Signing Key) &lt;productsecurity@netwrix.com&gt;&quot; PGP�key. The public key fingerprint is�<code>3F5EB22771A2BD66D1AA011A43E7B9B0AE7B49D8</code>�and can be obtained at�<a href="https://releases.netwrix.com/netwrixcorporation-pgp-signing.asc" target="_blank">https://releases.netwrix.com/netwrixcorporation-pgp-signing.asc</a>.</p>
