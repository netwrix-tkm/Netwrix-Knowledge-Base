    <h1>How AIC resource reviews work under the hood</h1>
    <p><strong>Issue:</strong> You need information about the tables that drive the AIC resource review process.</p>
<p>�</p>
<p>Reference: Stealthbits_SMP_AIC_DC_Schema PDF (Find in internal documentation folder &quot;\\sbitsinc.com\public\Documentation\Schema&quot;)</p>
<p>�</p>
<p><strong>How AIC resource reviews work under the hood</strong></p>
<p>NOTE: This information assumes you already have knowledge of how Access Information Center resource ownership and resource review workflows operate.� It discusses the implications of those things and how they interact with the database tables for them.</p>
<p><img src="https://nwxcorp--c.na147.content.force.com/sfc/dist/version/download/?oid=00D7000000091pB&amp;ids=0684u00000LcUmc&amp;d=%2Fa%2F4u000000LyJU%2FNFeTSMUKiXS_49_pDudnhYcX3_U2C6i5ZC9XzLSEnZk&amp;asPdf=false" alt="mceclip0.png"></img></p>
<p>�</p>
<p>�</p>
<p><strong>Creating a resources and assigning owners</strong></p>
<p>Let�s start by looking at the table SA_AIC_Resources (before we add a new resource).</p>
<p>SA_AIC_Resources:</p>
<p><img src="https://nwxcorp--c.na147.content.force.com/sfc/dist/version/download/?oid=00D7000000091pB&amp;ids=0684u00000LcWCB&amp;d=%2Fa%2F4u000000LyQ9%2FM89mqRHdjkmig9zRc2v02eEEXRpFoDuUobBhKOl82zc&amp;asPdf=false" alt="mceclip1.png"></img><br>This table simply keeps the list of resources that have had reviews requested.� Resource types are: 0=FileSystemShare, 1=SharePointResource, 2=ActiveDirectoryGroup, 3=ActiveDirectoryDistributionList, 4=LocalGroup, 5=FileSystemExport</p>
<p>�</p>
<p>�</p>
<p>Then let�s create a new resource, afterwards looking to see what the same table looks like.� I assigned a new owner for \\FS.SPIDER.LAB\TypicalDocuments.� Now my Resource Owners page in the AIC looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://nwxcorp--c.na147.content.force.com/sfc/dist/version/download/?oid=00D7000000091pB&amp;ids=0684u00000LcUVj&amp;d=%2Fa%2F4u000000LyIf%2FDIv8KVR_4LooLKUXfZ0n_mXINYfx.z.0jSvAHYxFqHc&amp;asPdf=false" alt="mceclip2.png"></img></p>
<p>Here�s SA_AIC_Resources (after the change� note the new entry with ID 5):</p>
<p><img src="https://nwxcorp--c.na147.content.force.com/sfc/dist/version/download/?oid=00D7000000091pB&amp;ids=0684u00000LcWCG&amp;d=%2Fa%2F4u000000LyQE%2FpUh_Gixer9CL3RyIwuHevSu103vE__PN7.fQuPquf1M&amp;asPdf=false" alt="mceclip3.png"></img><br>And here is SA_AIC_ResourceOwners:</p>
<p><img src="https://nwxcorp--c.na147.content.force.com/sfc/dist/version/download/?oid=00D7000000091pB&amp;ids=0684u00000LcUmr&amp;d=%2Fa%2F4u000000LyPq%2F7zaFL0smOceNTOLwiczOyBBEitMEajkaA5gBgCYqzL4&amp;asPdf=false" alt="mceclip4.png"></img></p>
<p>There is our newly added resource, ID 5 in SA_AIC_Resources.� You�ll see it�s not confirmed yet either by the owner in SA_AIC_ResourceOwners.</p>
<p><em>SIDE NOTE:� You might also notice that there is NOT an entry in the AIC for \\SA10TWO.SPIDER.LAB\TypicalDocs, but there IS any entry for that on line 4 of SA_AIC_Resources.� What�s going on with that you ask?� Resources that have been deleted in and have no owner are still retained in SA_AIC_Resources table.� This is so old resource review history can still be viewed for them.� (I actually deleted it because the name was the same as the one I was going to add, but on a different server, forgetting it worked this way.� So I will just have to trust that you are going to look at the whole UNC and not get confused.)</em></p>
<p>Once the owner confirms that they do own the resource, SA_AIC_ResourceOwners is updated.</p>
<p><img src="https://nwxcorp--c.na147.content.force.com/sfc/dist/version/download/?oid=00D7000000091pB&amp;ids=0684u00000LcVdc&amp;d=%2Fa%2F4u000000LyIq%2FpIxObczTR3mJnoUyyYcCKgje5xr0Giva1r0zTeEegEM&amp;asPdf=false" alt="mceclip5.png"></img></p>
<p>(If for some reason the owner confirmation was that they did NOT own the resource, �ConfirmResponse� would be set to 0 but ConfirmTime would still be set.� You�d still see the resource on the resource owners, list it just would say it was NOT confirmed with a red X under the confirmed column in the AIC.)</p>
<p>We will also see that SA_AIC_ResourceOptions lets us know if the resource allows adhoc permissions changes by the owner, or self-service access requests by users, plus the description field.� (In our case no resources allow either of those, hence the 0 for all resources in both AllowAdHoc and AllowRequests.)</p>
<p><img src="https://nwxcorp--c.na147.content.force.com/sfc/dist/version/download/?oid=00D7000000091pB&amp;ids=0684u00000LcWFZ&amp;d=%2Fa%2F4u000000LyQJ%2F7rUBfMhO3k5Kg1AQ7LLgjjukaVyNXskFKlS9wQXw2rk&amp;asPdf=false" alt="mceclip6.png"></img></p>
<p>If you use the �edit notes� option for the resource, you can add a note.</p>
<p><img src="https://nwxcorp--c.na147.content.force.com/sfc/dist/version/download/?oid=00D7000000091pB&amp;ids=0684u00000LcWFe&amp;d=%2Fa%2F4u000000LyQO%2FvcgLGr7GRuLmh2oYSvKLIrrtpMxYEV9pTP0wRXVwdOU&amp;asPdf=false" alt="mceclip7.png"></img></p>
<p>This also shows in the interface with a visual indicator when there is a note.</p>
<p><img src="https://nwxcorp--c.na147.content.force.com/sfc/dist/version/download/?oid=00D7000000091pB&amp;ids=0684u00000LcWFj&amp;d=%2Fa%2F4u000000LyQT%2F8beyotMYLopdru8thoR2IdEQRLQuSufU1HiuoswcBsg&amp;asPdf=false" alt="mceclip8.png"></img></p>
<p>�</p>
<p>Now we know what happens when a new resource is created and the owner confirmed, and the tables associated with those actions.</p>
<p><img src="https://nwxcorp--c.na147.content.force.com/sfc/dist/version/download/?oid=00D7000000091pB&amp;ids=0684u00000LcWFo&amp;d=%2Fa%2F4u000000LyQY%2FHsOBsAVVaIUsrz7fPK4OSx1QfmhSH5y59wYA64A.EdY&amp;asPdf=false" alt="mceclip9.png"></img></p>
<p>Additionally, there is a view with additional details about the resource owners - SA_AIC_ResourceOwnersView.� Here is an example:</p>
<p><img src="https://nwxcorp--c.na147.content.force.com/sfc/dist/version/download/?oid=00D7000000091pB&amp;ids=0684u00000LcUYn&amp;d=%2Fa%2F4u000000LyQd%2FyWX.CnHyEFwxSpZadvsGZty3FstqAvo6s5ufULqsfKU&amp;asPdf=false" alt="mceclip10.png"></img></p>
<p>�</p>
<p>�</p>
<p><strong>Access Requests</strong></p>
<p>To set up for the next section, I made 3 groups, gave them read/modify/full_control, rescanned FSAA and ADI.� Then I could edit a resource to enable the options to allow AdHoc permissions changes by the resource owners and allow access requests from users.</p>
<p><img src="https://nwxcorp--c.na147.content.force.com/sfc/dist/version/download/?oid=00D7000000091pB&amp;ids=0684u00000LcVNx&amp;d=%2Fa%2F4u000000LyQi%2FiVabV6Q4kULZCHtdNGNUVLHc3Fk9lqFOm5kG2ci9kZg&amp;asPdf=false" alt="mceclip11.png"></img></p>
<p>Here is SA_AIC_Resource_options after that change.� Note ID 3 which corresponds to the resource we changed.</p>
<p><img src="https://nwxcorp--c.na147.content.force.com/sfc/dist/version/download/?oid=00D7000000091pB&amp;ids=0684u00000LcWFy&amp;d=%2Fa%2F4u000000LyQn%2FQUvGQFU7GR0uxzuJ9Zblpz8hFYVWF1acGskN0cXHvnc&amp;asPdf=false" alt="mceclip12.png"></img></p>
<p>We also see an update to SA_AIC_ResourceAccessGroups.</p>
<p><img src="https://nwxcorp--c.na147.content.force.com/sfc/dist/version/download/?oid=00D7000000091pB&amp;ids=0684u00000LcWG3&amp;d=%2Fa%2F4u000000LyQs%2F98w8Pq3ZNSMF51cSsy0_bS7_vKPpCShWtPFnbP1JD8o&amp;asPdf=false" alt="mceclip13.png"></img></p>
<p>�</p>
<p>Now that users can request access, let�s submit a request.� Previously SA_AIC_ResourceAccessRequests was blank, but after submitting an access request we can see that entry.</p>
<p><img src="https://nwxcorp--c.na147.content.force.com/sfc/dist/version/download/?oid=00D7000000091pB&amp;ids=0684u00000LcWG8&amp;d=%2Fa%2F4u000000LyBj%2Fvxn.x7m3BB1stVKUiYRNveznOeYb879qq2LYAwcbqGA&amp;asPdf=false" alt="mceclip14.png"></img></p>
<p>When the owner approves the request, we will see that same table be updated again.</p>
<p><img src="https://nwxcorp--c.na147.content.force.com/sfc/dist/version/download/?oid=00D7000000091pB&amp;ids=0684u00000LcWGD&amp;d=%2Fa%2F4u000000LyQx%2FvEMuAV5INSh1P_zYUNBlF4x3lUBoBO7PLmkz6NDhhqk&amp;asPdf=false" alt="mceclip15.png"></img></p>
<p>If the AIC is NOT set up to automate the changes, the approval record will still be in the table!� It just won�t actually be in effect until whatever manual process is required to move the user into the right group happens.�</p>
<p>If you DO have the AIC set up to allow the AIC itself to automate changes, and the owner has permission to make ad-hoc changes to a user�s access on a resource, the owner will also have the �change access� button available when they select a resource from the Manage My Resources (Resource Ownership) page.</p>
<p><img src="https://nwxcorp--c.na147.content.force.com/sfc/dist/version/download/?oid=00D7000000091pB&amp;ids=0684u00000LcWBs&amp;d=%2Fa%2F4u000000LyR2%2FRxUKksBJW9buimJ1GE2PRX4qkzJ7Z6EoU.hUAsJfonM&amp;asPdf=false" alt="mceclip16.png"></img></p>
<p>(If AIC is not set to automate the changes in Configure Console, then this button will not be available. )</p>
<p>If a user�s access is changed with this method, it will also also show up in the SA_AIC_ResourceAccessRequests table.</p>
<p>�</p>
<p>We have seen the tables related to Access Requests and how they change during the request (or access change) process.</p>
<p>(Note that these examples show tables are from V10 StealthAUDIT.� V11 has additional fields in some of the tables, but the basic concepts are the same.)</p>
<p><img src="https://nwxcorp--c.na147.content.force.com/sfc/dist/version/download/?oid=00D7000000091pB&amp;ids=0684u00000LcUTi&amp;d=%2Fa%2F4u000000LyKb%2FXYwLG6Jmtq2W5.PZIBiF89hAuVwfFabSp.P1EOL2xKg&amp;asPdf=false" alt="mceclip17.png"></img></p>
<p>�</p>
<p>�</p>
<p><strong>Resource Reviews</strong></p>
<p>Now that we have covered the basics, we will delve into the complexities of Resource Reviews. ��Although there are more tables, we will look at how they are connected and what they store.</p>
<p>[I have deleted all resource reviews from my test machine before starting so all the resourcereview tables are empty.]</p>
<p><strong><em>Create Review</em></strong></p>
<p>First we will create a resource review.� I created an access review for one of my resources as an example, and named it �access review 1�.</p>
<p>Let�s see how the resource review tables and view look after doing that.</p>
<p>�</p>
<p>SA_AIC_ResourceReviews:</p>
<p><img src="https://nwxcorp--c.na147.content.force.com/sfc/dist/version/download/?oid=00D7000000091pB&amp;ids=0684u00000LcWJW&amp;d=%2Fa%2F4u000000LyFM%2FX5KRuAoKNlfFuiUidBCzdRbJIMHlxO5BDRGR4epc55E&amp;asPdf=false" alt="mceclip18.png"></img><br>This table simply shows the name, type, create time, and creator for the review.� Type 0 happens to be an access review.� You can find the access types in Appendix D of the AIC schema documentation, but for clarity I will list them here as well.� Review types: 0=access, 1=permissions, 2=membership, 3=sensitive data, 4=file review. <br><br></p>
<p>SA_AIC_ResourceReviewResponses:</p>
<p><img src="https://nwxcorp--c.na147.content.force.com/sfc/dist/version/download/?oid=00D7000000091pB&amp;ids=0684u00000LcUch&amp;d=%2Fa%2F4u000000LyR7%2F3atKpUUrhN0vOBuNeN9LGxxyZL76dG2gKa4yV118ZFc&amp;asPdf=false" alt="mceclip19.png"></img></p>
<p>This table is indicating who did the review AND allowing us to associate the ID of the review itself to the individual responses.� (Reponses will reference ID 19, but the review itself is ID 8.� These are two separate lists of things.)� This table also shows us the ResourceID, which refers to the ID of the resource as listed in SA_AIC_Resources (see info about that table above in Resource Owners section).<br><br></p>
<p>Be aware that there is also a related view called SA_AIC_ResourceReviewResponsesView.� This is simply a view that gives us more info joined to the info in SA_AIC_ResourceReviewResponses, to make it more useful for humans when viewing the info.� (We won�t look at the view unless there is something specific to call out in the rest of this discussion, but be aware it exists and can provide you extra contextual information.)</p>
<p>�</p>
<p>SA_AIC_ResourceReviewData:</p>
<p><img src="https://nwxcorp--c.na147.content.force.com/sfc/dist/version/download/?oid=00D7000000091pB&amp;ids=0684u00000LcWJb&amp;d=%2Fa%2F4u000000LyPg%2FMRgod_iiRkXjxBXXLjYocsaiAkrqo5h_7xYb8apwydM&amp;asPdf=false" alt="mceclip20.png"></img><br>This table shows all the data about all trustees with access.� (This is the purpose of the review�to show and let someone flag/comment on each trustee.)� You can see that each row has the �responseID� set to 19.� This is telling us each of those entries belongs to the review with the ID 19 in SA_AIC_ResourceReviewResponses.� In turn, the �reviewID� column in <em>that</em> table points us back to the actual review it with ID 8 in the table SA_AIC_ResourceReviews.</p>
<p>SA_AIC_ResourceReviewResponseDetails and SA_AIC_ResourceReviewResponseDetailsView:</p>
<p>Both empty for now, but when someone reviews that data these will be populated.</p>
<p>�</p>
<p><strong><em>Begin Review</em></strong></p>
<p>Lets log into the AIC as the owner of the resource with the review, and see what it looks like there.� When we click �Begin Review�, we see the list of trustees and their current permissions.� These correspond directly to the items in SA_AIC_ResourceReviewData.� Even though we don�t know the SIDs from that table, we can see there are three trustees with read access and three with full control.� (In this case each item is in the same order, but this is not guaranteed when selecting from the table.)</p>
<p>One item to note is the recommendation for one trustee that says �None: No domain login for 60 days�.� This is auto-populated for us based on the trustee not having logged in to the domain for a long time.�</p>
<p><img src="https://nwxcorp--c.na147.content.force.com/sfc/dist/version/download/?oid=00D7000000091pB&amp;ids=0684u00000LcWJl&amp;d=%2Fa%2F4u000000LyRC%2FDDGhAIXNJ92e9daWjoaaGBN6eB.x94Qst4jKgsG9.e0&amp;asPdf=false" alt="mceclip21.png"></img></p>
<p><br><strong><em>Recommend Change</em></strong><br><br>If we make a change, we can observe the results in the associate tables.� After changing the Authenticated Users trustee to recommend modify permissions and clicking SAVE (without clicking next to finish the review), we will see an addition to the following tables/views:</p>
<p>SA_AIC_ResourceReviewResponseDetails:</p>
<p><img src="https://nwxcorp--c.na147.content.force.com/sfc/dist/version/download/?oid=00D7000000091pB&amp;ids=0684u00000LcWJq&amp;d=%2Fa%2F4u000000LyCO%2Fq5Tqi_SNIlnO.D3zRp5MigZp2OfKqn0dDC6dyXjzzV4&amp;asPdf=false" alt="mceclip22.png"></img></p>
<p>You can see that SA_AIC_ResourceReviewResponseDetails is recording our suggested permissions change in the DesiredValue column.� The ResponseID, ItemName, and TrusteeType are used to associate this response back to the item with the same values in the table SA_AIC_ResourceReviewData (which contains the initial values info).</p>
<p>Be aware there is a related view named SA_AIC_ResourceReviewResponseDetailsView, which simply gives more info about the items in SA_AIC_ResourceReviewResponseDetails.� (We won�t look at the view unless there is something specific to call out in the rest of this discussion, but be aware it exists and can provide you extra contextual information.)</p>
<p>�</p>
<p><strong><em>Submit Changes</em></strong></p>
<p>If we click NEXT in the resource review, we will then be allowed to enter any notes about our recommended changes. �I will enter one we can see for our one suggested change, and then hit Submit.</p>
<p>We will see that SA_AIC_ResourceReviewResponseDetails now has our Note for that user:</p>
<p><img src="https://nwxcorp--c.na147.content.force.com/sfc/dist/version/download/?oid=00D7000000091pB&amp;ids=0684u00000LcWJv&amp;d=%2Fa%2F4u000000LyRH%2FIKu7qHSJ0nXnx64igf7epaTvBaxRy1en1lrKD0s0_NQ&amp;asPdf=false" alt="mceclip23.png"></img></p>
<p>SA_AIC_ResourceReviewResponses also has been updated with the review info, now that the review has been completed and submitted:</p>
<p><img src="https://nwxcorp--c.na147.content.force.com/sfc/dist/version/download/?oid=00D7000000091pB&amp;ids=0684u00000LcVdl&amp;d=%2Fa%2F4u000000LyRM%2FSVEloB7BQx31jpmD_H.FEdY6RSITYUyrWtynPWQp.kE&amp;asPdf=false" alt="mceclip24.png"></img></p>
<p><strong><em>Approve/Deny Changes</em></strong></p>
<p>The review now goes back to the original requestor, who will look at the recommendations made and approve or deny the individual responses.� In this case, I will accept our change on the individual trustee.� This updates the table SA_AIC_ResourceReviewResponseDetails with the AdminResponse (0=accept, 1=decline, 2=defer), as well as the AdminTime and AdminSID columns.</p>
<p><img src="https://nwxcorp--c.na147.content.force.com/sfc/dist/version/download/?oid=00D7000000091pB&amp;ids=0684u00000LcUdz&amp;d=%2Fa%2F4u000000LyRR%2FwyAx5wM.X2ljPwVdosf_MtblaLTBXtqtJYRvGASlFHI&amp;asPdf=false" alt="mceclip25.png"></img></p>
<p><em>SIDE NOTE: This document does not discuss the �process changes� option.� Maybe it just bulk agrees or denies the suggested changes?</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Finish Review</em></strong></p>
<p>If the review requestor then returns to the Manage Reviews screen, they will have the ability to use the �Mark Completed� button to finalize the review process.� When they do, SA_AIC_ResourceReviews will be updated with the FinishTime.</p>
<p><img src="https://nwxcorp--c.na147.content.force.com/sfc/dist/version/download/?oid=00D7000000091pB&amp;ids=0684u00000LcWBT&amp;d=%2Fa%2F4u000000LyRW%2FNsdTBuQWsOZZLZRu4Vek4pFl..z4vuB1MBYT0pXw5yo&amp;asPdf=false" alt="mceclip26.png"></img></p>
<p><strong><em>Run Again</em></strong></p>
<p>If the �Run Again� button is chosen for a completed review, a new copy of it (with a new ID) is created in SA_AIC_ResourceReviews, and the entire process begins again for that new review.</p>
<p><img src="https://nwxcorp--c.na147.content.force.com/sfc/dist/version/download/?oid=00D7000000091pB&amp;ids=0684u00000LcUqU&amp;d=%2Fa%2F4u000000LyRb%2F0Pi5wTYTPZIffS9ETm31sMdEsy7c_ujsQ_dl2fgWB8Q&amp;asPdf=false" alt="mceclip27.png"></img></p>
<p>�</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion + Review process steps</strong></p>
<p>This was a basic walkthrough of how the various tables are used to keep track of items in the Resource Owners and Resource Reviews portion of the AIC.� In a real environment, there would likely be more trustees and perhaps different recommendations for each, but they would just be recorded in the appropriate tables.��</p>
<p>I hope this walkthrough was useful to you.� Here is an overview of the steps in the review process that make changes to the various review tables.�</p>
