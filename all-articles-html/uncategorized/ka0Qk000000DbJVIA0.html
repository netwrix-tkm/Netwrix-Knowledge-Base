    <h1>What to do When the Access Analyzer Job Tree Disappears</h1>
    <p><strong><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large">Summary:</span></strong> From time to time customers email stating that their job tree is no longer populated within Access Analyzer. This is typically caused by blank or corrupted job XML files.</p>
<p><strong><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large">Issue:</span></strong> When a customer reaches out stating that their job tree is missing from the console or only partially loading it is typically caused by a blank or corrupted Job XML file somewhere in the job tree. These blank or corrupted XML files are typically caused by a forced reboot of the server during a job execution, or when disk space for the drive hosting the Access Analyzer application is depleted. <br>Emails describing this issue will typically come in during Patch Cycles. The XML files are blank most times because during a scheduled task execution the XML file is held open until the job finishes at which time it is saved. If the server is forcibly rebooted then the XML doesn&#39;t get a chance to properly save.</p>
<p><strong><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large">Instructions:</span></strong> The easiest way to resolve this issue is to get on a call with the customer and find the job with the corrupted XML and restore it to the working state. Step to find the corrupted XML are as follows.<br>ï¿½</p>
<ol><li>Launch Access Analyzer and observe the state of the job tree
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;"><li>Empty</li><li>Partially displayed</li></ol>
</li><li>For Empty Job Tree take the following steps

Typically the XML file will be 0kb in size</li><li>Go into the output folder and copy the job XML file back into the main job folder overwriting the corrupted or blank XML</li><li>Go back into Access Analyzer and refresh the Jobs Tree</li><li>Repeat Until Entire Jobs Tree is visible.</li></ol>
</li><li>For Partially Displayed Job Tree
