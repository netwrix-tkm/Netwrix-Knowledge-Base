    <h1>How To: Enable Group Owner Suggestion in the Portal</h1>
    <h2><span style="color: #2980b9;"><b>Applies To:</b></span></h2>
<p>Directory Manager 11�� Directory Manager Portal</p>
<h2><span style="color: #2980b9;"><b>Business Scenario:</b></span></h2>
<p>As a common scenario, groups get orphaned and stay in the directory as such, unnoticed and unattended. After all, users come and leave, and its virtually impossible for network administrators to keep a manual check on all directory groups.</p>
<p>But even when you claim to vigilantly monitor group ownership to pinpoint orphan groups, there is still a trap. How to come up with the most appropriate choice for the group owner? What parameters should come into play when promoting a user or group as a group owner?</p>
<p>Well, Directory Manager saves your nerves by giving simple, automated, data-driven solutions.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #2980b9;"><b>Solution:</b></span></h2>
<p>Directory Manager can help you deal with the orphan group challenge in two distinct ways:</p>
<ul><li><b>Define an Orphan Group Update job for an identity store and schedule its runs.</b><br>The Directory Manager administrator can define this job in Directory Manager Admin Console&gt;Identity store properties&gt;Schedules. When this job runs, it scans orphan groups in the directory and automatically assigns an owner to each of these.</li><li><b>Enable Group Owner Suggestion in the Directory Manager portal.</b><br>The Directory Manager portal can dynamically suggest an owner for an orphan group. Unlike the Orphan Group Update job that sets a group owner without user intervention, the Owner Suggestion feature allows the user to choose an owner from a list of suggested users. Directory Manager conjures up this list by taking the group membership into account, ranking stronger matches at the top.</li></ul>
<p>This article focuses on the owner suggestion solution for dealing with orphan groups.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #2980b9;"><b>Group Owner Suggestion Configuration:</b></span></h2>
<p>To enable the Directory Manager portal to present group owner suggestions, you must enable the�<b>Suggest Owner/Manager</b>�setting for a portal.</p>
<p>1. In Directory Manager Admin Console, select�<b>Application&gt; Directory Manager Portals &gt; [required portal]</b></p>
<p>2. Click the three dots and go to�<strong>Settings&gt;Advanced Settings&gt;Misc</strong> and scroll down to the Suggest Owner/Manager setting. This setting sets the Self-Service portal to suggest owners for orphan groups and managers for users without managers.</p>
<p>�</p>

<p>�</p>
<p>3. Enable this option to allow Directory Manager to suggest a primary owner for an orphan group (on the�<b>Owner</b>�tab in group properties).<br>The owner is suggested with respect to the group�s membership; Directory Manager checks the managers of group members and the user who shows up most as a manager is suggested as the group owner. This user may or may not be a member of the group.<br><b>Example:</b><br>When 40 members of Group A have User A as their manager and 38 members have User B as a manager, User A is suggested as Group A�s primary owner. User A may not necessarily be a member of Group A.</p>
<p>4. Click the�<b>Save</b> icon on the toolbar.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #2980b9;"><b>How Owner Suggestion works in the Portal:</b></span></h2>
<p>Log into the portal. Go to the properties page of an orphan group and click the�<b>Owner</b>�tab.</p>
<p>�</p>

<p>�</p>
<p>Notice that an owner has been suggested for the group.</p>
<ul><li>Click�<b>Make Owner</b>�to set the suggested user as the group&#39;s primary owner.</li><li>If you want to look at more options before setting an owner, click�<b>Show more options</b>�to view a list of suggested owners.</li></ul>
<p>Once you�re done, make sure you save the information.</p>
