    <p><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper confluence-embedded-manual-size"><img class="confluence-embedded-image" height="66" width="155" src="https://nwxcorp--c.na147.content.force.com/sfc/dist/version/download/?oid=00D7000000091pB&amp;ids=0684u00000LdKMX&amp;d=%2Fa%2F4u000000LzV9%2FBbnCO6fwX0h96OINHH6LPxi41H3SHPmRZHfL7GPa5Q0&amp;asPdf=false"></img></span></p><h1 id="SupportProcess-Forwhenyoudon�tknowtheAnswer!-SupportProcess.Forwhenyoudon&#39;tknowtheAnswer!">Support Process. For when you don&#39;t know the Answer!</h1><p>There will be times during your NNT career when you are faced with either a problem you do not know the answer to or even an area of an NNT solution that you are unfamiliar with. When this happens you should consider the following:</p><h2 id="SupportProcess-Forwhenyoudon�tknowtheAnswer!-Preparation&amp;Approach">Preparation &amp; Approach</h2><p><span class="confluence-anchor-link conf-macro output-inline" id="SupportProcess-Forwhenyoudon�tknowtheAnswer!-_GoBack"><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="_GoBack"> </span></span></p><p>If you have an agreed session with a customer then do as much prep as possible, do not go into the session cold!<br><strong>Install the product</strong> - Essential if you are unsure about a feature of a product. If time allows get an installation of the product in question and &#39;play&#39; with the feature before any session with the customer. It also helps to have the software at hand during a session.<br><strong>Review manuals</strong> - The Change Tracker manuals in dropbox contain information about most of the features within the Change Tracker product. If you are dealing with Log Tracker then the manuals can be found in the &#39;Home&#39; tab of the install of within the &#39;s-docs&#39; folder of the installation path.<br><strong>Speak to your colleagues</strong> - No one is an island, we all have strengths and weaknesses in our product knowledge which largely comes down to experience and note taking. If you are unsure and unable to figure out how something works from the manuals and testing, ask a college. Note, its best to ask for help as far in advance of working with the customer, don&#39;t leave it until you are on the session.<br>If you have prepared as best you can but are still unsure, or if you have been blindsided by a question on a session, try and project a confident demeanour and use terms like:<br>(if you have a rough idea) <br><em>My understanding of how it works is�.</em><br><em>Perhaps we should come back to this on a later session�.</em><br><em>Let me take this away and come back to you.</em><br><em>I think I&#39;ll check on that if you don&#39;t mind and come back to you with an answer.</em></p><p><br></p><h2 id="SupportProcess-Forwhenyoudon�tknowtheAnswer!-InformationGathering">Information Gathering</h2><p>If you are going to offer to take the problem/question away then gathering as much information as possible is key. You are going to have to explain this to someone else after all.<br>Start with the basics, get the software version numbers and if relevant, the details of the operating system which the software is running on.<br>If you are dealing with a problem, i.e. the software not working as it should, gather log files. Change and Log Tracker all write to log files but also don&#39;t forget any operating system log files such as:</p><ul><li>The Windows Event Viewer</li><li>On Linux /var/logs/messages</li><li>If dealing with Change Tracker on Linux then Nginx creates log files</li></ul><p>It&#39;s also important that you gather a good description of either the problem or, if it&#39;s general feature question, what the customer would like to do.<br>If you are dealing with a problem then collect detailed steps of how to reproduce the problem. This is the first question you&#39;ll be asked when you try and escalate!<br>If you are dealing with a &quot;can the software do this..&quot;, ensure that you have as much detail as possible from the person asking the question. Tip, it is always a good idea to echo back to the customer the question which they have asked. That way you can both be certain that you understand. <br>Ask the customer how he or she would like the feature to work. It&#39;s always good to collect people&#39;s point of view and they may have good ideas! Even if the software doesn&#39;t work that way, it&#39;s possible that we can adjust in the future. <br class="atl-forced-newline"><br class="atl-forced-newline"></p><p><br></p>
