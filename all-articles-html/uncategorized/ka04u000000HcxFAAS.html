    <h1>How to Undo AD Deprovision Users Actions for Disabling and Changing Descriptions</h1>
    <p><strong><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large">Summary:</span></strong> On the support team we frequently get emails from customers who see jobs that have run but that have blank reports. Their first inclination is to attempt to fix things by checking all of the boxes in the job that are unchecked. This includes the action tasks in the AD Cleanup Jobs. One such customer needed assistance in rolling back the actions after they had run and disabled 2000 users as well as changing the description to TO BE DELETED. Attached is a modified version of the stock job that has 2 extra actions for undoing the disable and description change</p><p><strong><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large">Issue:</span></strong> Customer panics because they have disabled 2000 users by enabling the actions in the cleanup tasks and running the job. My particular customer hadn&#39;t successfully run the move action or the delete action so the attached job only deals with the Disable Stale Users action and the Change Description action.</p><p><strong><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large">Instructions:</span></strong> The hardest part of rolling back these actions is finding the action result tables. They don&#39;t follow standard table naming schema so the names are as follows for the out of the box job: 
</p><ol><li>Disable Users Action Result Table: SA_AD_DeprovisionUsers_Details_Disable_Users
</li><li>Change Description Action Result Table: SA_AD_DeprovisionUsers_Details_Update_Description_Results</li></ol>Once the action result tables have been identified they need to be exposed in the job by creating 2 blank SQL Analysis tasks that have the result tables in the table name box at the top so that they are exposed in the results tab.<br>�<br>Once the tables are exposed in the results tab actions can be built to target the result tables as the source for the new action. For the description change the previous description is stored in what is essentially an OLD VALUE column. Create an action to update the description and instead of typing in the desired description, use the insert option to point to the old value column. Once that is done use the default DC and your action is ready to go.<br>�<br>Once the tables are exposed in the results tab target the disable Users result table with an action to enable users. Use SID as the unique identifier and target the default DC. This action should be primed and ready to go.<br>�<br>Run each of your custom actions manually and disable ALL actions when you are finished. Explain to the customer that the reports were previously blank because they are reporting on the status of any stale object remediation done by the actions. If the customer is getting blank reports make sure that the option to select do no email reports if blank is unchecked. If they don&#39;t want to see the blank reports in the console or on the report website then delete them from published reports and in 8.1 hide the jobs in the tree and in 8.2 disable the cleanup tasks.<br>�<br><br><br><a href="https://downloads.stealthbits.com/access/files/Solution_Sets/Undo_AD_Deprovision_Users_Actions_Set/JOB_AD_DeprovisionUsers.zip" target="_blank">https://downloads.stealthbits.com/access/files/Solution_Sets/Undo_AD_Deprovision_Users_Actions_Set/JOB_AD_DeprovisionUsers.zip</a><p><strong><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large">Product:</span></strong> StealthAUDIT<br><strong><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large">Module:</span></strong> SA - Solution Set - Active Directory<br><strong><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large">Versions:</span></strong> 7.0+<br><strong><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large">Salesforce Article ID:</span></strong> 2286<br></p>
