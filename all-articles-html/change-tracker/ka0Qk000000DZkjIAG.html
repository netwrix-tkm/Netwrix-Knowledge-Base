    <h1>The Netwrix FAST� Cloud Usage Considerations</h1>
    <p>The Netwrix FAST� Cloud, powered by external Threat Intelligence feeds, really does take Change Control to the next level and makes the whole process of handling events even easier by automating the analysis and approvals process.�File changes can be automatically and instantly verified as �known safe� as they are detected. (I.e. minimising Change Noise � leaving only unrecognised File Changes flagged up for investigation)</p><p>Netwrix FAST is a truly powerful solution to change detection, however, with great power comes great responsibility and to get the most from FAST it is imperative that your Change Tracker should be configured correctly. Here are a few dos and don&#39;ts to be aware of when working with the Netwrix FAST Cloud.</p><p><strong>Do be specific with your monitoring</strong> - Take some time and work with your Netwrix Support representative to compile monitoring templates which accurately represents your organization. Bear in mind that while the FAST whitelist contains millions of files, common to all major operating systems and available applications, the cloud will not contain a record of all files in your environment!</p><p><strong>Don&#39;t monitor the entire drive!</strong> - The temptation with FAST is to simply point Change Tracker at all files on a single drive! This, however, will create a large number of change events, particularly from files which will never be listed by FAST such as log files and will leave you with a massive amount of unplanned changes to review.</p><p><strong>Do use planned change rules</strong> - If you have proprietary files which need to be tracked but will obviously never be listed in the FAST Cloud, work with Netwrix Support to create a planned change rule set so these files are picked up by an FAST alternative rule and marked as planned.</p><p><strong>Do adjust your patching schedules</strong> - If you are currently patching immediately after a scheduled release, or have automatic updates enabled, please consider that these known good file hashes may not necessarily have reached FAST cloud as they are still being analyzed by our whitelisting experts. The recommended best practice would be to wait 2-4 weeks after a patch has been released by the vendor prior to rolling it out in your environment - permitting this is possible and if the patch is not an absolute necessity. This will ensure that FAST Cloud will contain all the necessary file hashes to fully remediate the changes generated by the patch, and also mitigate any potential post patch problems with rolling out a patch too early; which can lead to system failure until the vendor releases a fix.�</p><p>That is all there is to it ;-) Hopefully, these points help to guide you in the use of the FAST Cloud but if you have any questions, please contact Netwrix Support through the <a class="external-link" href="https://supportnntws.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/3" target="_blank">Helpdesk Portal</a> or by emailing <a class="external-link" href="mailto:Support@nntws.com" target="_blank">Support@nntws.com</a>.
