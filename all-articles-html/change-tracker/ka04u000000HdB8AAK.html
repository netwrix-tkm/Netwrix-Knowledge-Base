    <h1>Differences between Greenbone Community Feed and the Enterprise Feed</h1>
    <p>There are three main areas of difference between the professional solution and the community edition.</p><p><u><strong>1) The feed</strong></u><br>The following list gives some examples of those professional enterprise-grade products which are only part of the professional Greenbone Security Feed:<br>- Generally, all Enterprise-grade products and all OT (i.e. ICS/SCADA) products<br>- MS Windows Server and back office solutions (e.g.: SharePoint, sql Server, others)<br>- Products from Palo Alto Networks, Cisco, Juniper Networks and Fortinet<br>- Oracle Solaris IBM WebSphere products (i.e. IBM WebSphere Application Server)<br>- Lotus Notes or SAP products<br>- VMWare paid products</p><p><u><strong>2) Solution delivery, deployment, and support</strong></u><br>Probably nothing surprising here, the professional solution gets a full, SLA based support. The community edition not. There is more related to the appliances, which may not be relevant here.</p><p><u><strong>3) Features</strong></u><br>The basic features are the same, still, some enterprise-oriented features are not part of the community edition. As examples:<br>- feed updates via S-Proxy<br>- system updates and upgrades included in the feed<br>- connectors to other Enterprise products like PaloAlto firewalls, SIEM systems, similar<br>- backup/restore, alarms/schedules<br>- Master/Slave architecture</p>
