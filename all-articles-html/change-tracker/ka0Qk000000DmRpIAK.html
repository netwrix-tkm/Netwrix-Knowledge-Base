    <h1>Log Tracker - What is the &quot;Netwrix Log Tracker Tunnel Sender Service&quot; and how does it work?</h1>
    <p><em>Do you need to monitor devices in a DMZ/PCI zone which is isolated from the internet or has limited access to the network where your Log Tracker software is installed? Is there a single server within the PCI zone that has access to the internal/unsecure network, which can be used to feed all of the logs from your monitored devices to your Log Tracker server? If so, read on because this is the guide for you...</em></p><p>In order to achieve what has been described above, you can utilise the &quot;Netwrix Log Tracker Tunnel Sender Service&quot;.</p><p>The Tunnel Sender is easy to get up and running. You setup a tunnel &quot;Receiver&quot; on the Log Tracker Server, and then setup a tunnel &quot;Sender&quot; on the secondary server you have configured (the secondary server will act as your feed to the internal/unsecure network). The tunnel &quot;Sender&quot; listens for messages on UDP port 514 and then sends these messages via TCP (with optional encryption) to the tunnel &quot;Receiver&quot; on the Log Tracker server. Log Tracker receives the TCP messages where they are then resent to Log Tracker using standard UDP.</p><p>The Tunnel process uses TCP port 51462 by default but this port number can be easily modified.</p><p>We�ve listed below how it would be configured in a production environment and we�ve also provided a diagram to show how the monitored devices, tunnel sender, tunnel receiver and Log Tracker server will communicate together.</p><p><span style="color: rgb(153,204,0);"><strong><u>Inside the PCI Zone:</u></strong></span></p><ol><li><span style="color: rgb(153,204,0);">A Tunnel sender would be installed on a random Windows server which has access to the <span style="color: rgb(128,0,128);">Internal zone</span>.</span></li><li><span style="color: rgb(153,204,0);">Other Windows servers, Linux servers and network devices within the PCI Zone would be configured to send their syslog messages to the Tunnel Sender using UDP port 514.</span></li><li><span style="color: rgb(153,204,0);">The Tunnel Sender will listen for the syslog messages and then send them via TCP port 51462 to the Tunnel Receiver in the <span style="color: rgb(128,0,128);">Internal zone</span>.
