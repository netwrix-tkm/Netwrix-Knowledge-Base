    <h1>2 Technical Overview</h1>
    <h1 id="id-2TechnicalOverview-TechnicalOverview"><span style="color: rgb(46,116,181);"><strong>Technical Overview</strong></span></h1><p>NNT Change Tracker is a file integrity monitoring product, used for compliance programs, host intrusion detection and change control for enterprise IT systems. It is used by Enterprise IT organizations including the military, federal, banks, financial services, airlines, retailers, utilities and not-for-profit organizations around the world.</p><p><br> The product automates the collection of configuration data from any IT devices, including Servers and Desktops, database systems, firewalls, network routers and switches and stores a baseline for each device. Platforms supported include Windows, Linux, Unix, Oracle, SQL Server. <br> Configuration data collected is then analyzed for compliance with an organizations hardened build standard. This is typically based on a CIS Benchmark hardening checklist or one provided by a manufacturer such as Microsoft, Red Hat, Oracle or Cisco, for example. Compliance standards supported by Change Tracker include PCI DSS, DISA STIG, NERC CIP, ISO 27001, GLBA), FISMA), HIPAA HITECH, S-OX, NIST 800-53 and GPG 13.</p><p><br> <span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper confluence-embedded-manual-size"><img class="confluence-embedded-image" height="161" width="523" src="https://nwxcorp--c.na147.content.force.com/sfc/dist/version/download/?oid=00D7000000091pB&amp;ids=0684u00000LdJxM&amp;d=%2Fa%2F4u000000LzPq%2FtPfjPbZSZ6bcBCCl.eg6do2.QwY7d7Kggabhyn390vs&amp;asPdf=false"></img></span><br> Devices are then monitored continuously using either a Change Tracker Agent installed directly onto the device, or using a periodically scheduled agentless interaction with the device. Any changes recorded deviating from the initial baseline are assessed for a match with Planned Changes configured in the Change Tracker system. Planned Change rules can be recorded directly from a device exhibiting changes, for example, when pre-staging patches, or from observed changes reported by Change Tracker. The make-up of a Planned Change comprises the range of devices to assess, time window and details of the changes to match, such as a file change or registry value, for example. Due to the nature/variety of patches, hundreds of Planned Change rules can be active at any one time.</p><p><br> This feature has been referred to as Closed-Loop, Intelligent Change Control through its close alignment to COBIT or ITIL Change Control processes whereby changes are pre-approved via a &#39;Request For Change&#39; process, then reviewed for accuracy and quality via a QA Testing or Post-implementation review. Change Tracker automates this entire process by reviewing changes observed against pre-defined Planned Change rules, or by retrospectively building new Planned Change Rules based on observed changes, hence the Closed-Loop terminology.<br> Any changes recorded that are not matched by a Planned Change rule are reported as being potentially breach activity. In this way, Change Tracker provides a Host Intrusion Detection System capability.</p><p><br> NNT products have been awarded Security Software Certification for CIS Benchmarks. NNT is also an official OVAL Adopter utilizing OVAL vulnerability, inventory and compliance content in either SCAP or xccdf content.</p><p><br> NNT products have also received a series of Five Star reviews from SC Magazine.</p>
