    <h1>Performance Degradation and Database Issues After Custom Job Update</h1>
    <blockquote>
<div><span style="color: #c0392b;"><strong>!</strong></span> This article is currently under review. Some of the information below may not be up to date.</div>
</blockquote>

<h2>Symptom</h2>

<div>
<p>Following the replacement of the original LANSweeper collection job with a new version utilizing the ODBC data collector, significant performance degradation and database issues were observed.</p>

<p>After implementing the new version of the LANSweeper collection job, the runtime of the job increased drastically up to 2 hours over couple of days.</p>
</div>

<h2>Cause</h2>

<div>
<p>The <b>StealthAUDIT database</b> exhibited numerous queries in a suspended state. These suspensions primarily occurred when a query attempted to access a table with a write-lock applied due to another query already acting upon it. Additionally, high CPU usage and Disk I/O latency were observed, collectively leading to a significant slowdown in database transactions.</p>
</div>

<h2>Resolution</h2>

<div>
<p>Follow the steps below to resolve the issue:</p>

<ol><li>
	<p>The AD_GroupPolicy job, which was identified as a contributing factor to the Disk I/O latency, was terminated. This action resulted in a return to normal Disk I/O latency levels, although high CPU usage persisted.</p>
	</li><li>
	<p>Perform Packet Capture (PCAP) on the LANSweeper, Enterprise Auditor, and Enterprise Auditor database hosts. Link?</p>
	</li></ol>
</div>

<h3>Recommendations</h3>

<div>
<ul><li>
	<p>Regularly monitor system performance metrics to detect and address any emerging issues promptly.</p>
	</li><li>
	<p>Implement job prioritization and optimization strategies to mitigate resource contention and improve overall system performance.</p>
	</li><li>
	<p>Conduct periodic Packet Capture analysis to identify and resolve any network-related issues affecting data transmission and integrity.</p>
	</li></ul>
