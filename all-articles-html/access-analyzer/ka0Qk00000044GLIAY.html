    <h1>How to Locate Database Files and Applet Logs for All FSAA Scan Types</h1>
    <h2>Overview</h2>

<p>This article describes Tier 2 database and log locations for the various FSAA scans (Netwrix Enterprise Auditor 9.0+). Additionally, this document covers the following related topics:</p>

<ul><li>Conditions for Sending Tier 2 Databases from Netwrix Enterprise Auditor Console to Proxy Server or Applet Host in 9.0+ FSAA</li><li>How FSAA Determines if a Scan Should Run</li><li>Tier 1 vs. Tier 2 GUID Mismatch</li><li>Moving the Location of the FSAA Folder on Proxy Servers or Applet Hosts</li></ul>

<h2>Instructions</h2>

<p>There are several different scan modes that the FS Data Collector can leverage. The location of the Tier 2 databases and logs will vary, depending on that mode.</p>

<p>This article assumes that Netwrix Enterprise Auditor is installed with a path ending in ...\Netwrix Enterprise Auditor\. Otherwise, the FSAA folder will be located in ...\Netwrix Enterprise Auditor\FSAA in the parent folder of the installation directory.</p>

<p>The registry key containing the SAINSTALLDIR value is: HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\Environment</p>

<p>That registry key�s existence is checked when the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor applet is deployed. If it doesn�t exist, then the default path for %SAINSTALLDIR% is used: C:\Program Files (x86)\STEALTHbits\Netwrix Enterprise Auditor</p>

<h3>Log Types</h3>

<p>Below are various logs associated with FSAA scans and jobs. The locations of these logs are included with the scan mode information to follow. In addition to these logs, Tier 2s should be included for relevant hosts when troubleshooting scan or bulk import issues.</p>

<ul><li><strong>Applet Logs</strong> � Often contains the most important troubleshooting information. Host scanning is performed by the applet, and these logs contain information, warnings, and errors experienced during FSAA scans. Applet logs should be included when troubleshooting scan and bulk import issues.</li><li><strong>RPC Logs</strong> � Contains information, warnings, and errors related to communication (e.g., network, I/O) during scans. RPC logs should be included when troubleshooting scan and communication issues.</li><li><strong>Job Logs</strong> � Contains information, warnings, and errors related to Netwrix Enterprise Auditor Console setup before the FSAA applet is launched. Job logs may also contain certain scan messages, although applet logs typically have more information in that regard. All bulk import messages are also included in the job logs. Job logs should be included when troubleshooting scan and bulk import issues.</li><li><strong>Sensitive Data Logs</strong> � There are two new logs in v10.0+ that include information about sensitive data scans. These are ScannerLib and Extractor. Both logs will be in a host�s specific FSAA directory and should be included when troubleshooting issues regarding sensitive data. When running sensitive data scans with multiple threads, there will be one ScannerLib and one Extractor log per thread. By default, FSAA sensitive data scans run with four threads, so there will be four ScannerLib logs and four Extractor logs.</li></ul>

<h3>Common Scenarios &amp; What to Include</h3>

<p>In all troubleshooting scenarios, various database and log files will be requested. Please provide all requested materials, as each piece provides important troubleshooting information. If unsure of what to provide, at a minimum please provide each affected host�s FSAA\ folder.</p>

<p>In various specific troubleshooting scenarios, the following database and log files must be provided:</p>

<ul><li><strong>Scan &amp; Network Issues</strong> � Applet logs, job logs, RPC logs</li><li><strong>Data Validity Concerns</strong> � Tier 2 database files, screenshot showing data validity concern</li><li><strong>Bulk Import Issues</strong> � Tier 2 database files, job logs</li><li><strong>Sensitive Data Issues</strong> � Applet logs, job logs, and sensitive data logs (ScannerLib/Extractor)</li></ul>

<h3>Local Mode</h3>

<p>A persistent network connection is used to collect data from the target and send it to the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor Console server.</p>

<p>Tier 2 databases are created locally on the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor Console while the scan is running, in per-host folders in the FSAA directory.</p>

<p>Applet logs are stored on the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor Console in: FSAA\</p>

<p>RPC logs are stored on the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor Console in: FSAA for the parent RPC logs, FSAA\ for each child RPC log</p>

<p>Job logs are stored on the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor Console in: %SAINSTALLDIR%\Jobs\\Output</p>

<h3>Applet Mode</h3>

<p>An applet is deployed to the Windows scan target, and the scan runs on the target instead of collecting data over the network. For non-Windows hosts, an active network connection is used to collect data from the target and send it to the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor Console server.</p>

<p>Tier 2 databases are sent to the applet host if they exist on the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor Console server. Otherwise, they are created on the applet host. In either case, Tier 2s are then zipped and copied to the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor Console�s per-host FSAA folders when the target scan is finished.</p>

<p>Applet logs are stored in FSAA\ folders on each applet host. The logs are copied to the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor Console when the target scan is finished.</p>

<p>RPC logs are stored in the FSAA folder and in FSAA\ folders on each applet host. The logs are copied to the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor Console when the target scan is finished.</p>

<p>Job logs are stored on the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor Console in: %SAINSTALLDIR%\Jobs\\Output</p>

<h3>Proxy Mode</h3>

<p>Scans are performed from a remote proxy server to help distribute resources and localize scans geographically to improve performance for large deployments and slow links. Proxy servers act like a Netwrix Enterprise Auditor Console scanning in local mode.</p>

<p>Tier 2 databases are sent to the proxy server if they exist on the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor Console server. Otherwise, they are created on the proxy server. Tier 2s are then zipped and copied to the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor Console�s per-host FSAA folders when the target scans are finished.</p>

<p>Proxy Mode has two workflow options:</p>

<ul><li><strong>Standard Proxy</strong> � An applet is sent from the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor Console to the proxy server and started through a remote scheduled task.</li><li><strong>FSAA as a Service</strong> � FSAA is installed on the proxy server as a service, rather than sending a proxy applet during each scan.</li></ul>

<p>In both modes, FSAA uses a persistent network connection between the proxy server and the target hosts for collecting data.</p>

<p>Applet logs are stored in FSAA\ folders on the proxy server. The logs are copied to the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor Console when the target scan is finished.</p>

<p>RPC logs are stored in the FSAA folder and in FSAA\ folders on the proxy server. The logs are copied to the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor Console when the target scan is finished.</p>

<p>Job logs are stored on the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor Console in: %SAINSTALLDIR%\Jobs\\Output</p>

<h3>Conditions for Sending Tier 2 Databases from Netwrix Enterprise Auditor Console to Proxy Server or Applet Host in 9.0+ FSAA</h3>

<p>FSAA collects the GUID, USN, and ScanCompleted values from the TBL_FSAA_Sequence table on the proxy server or applet host (e.g., RemoteGUID, RemoteUSN, and RemoteScanCompleted). FSAA also collects the GUID, USN, and ScanCompleted values from TBL_FSAA_Sequence table from the local Netwrix Enterprise Auditor Console (e.g., LocalGUID, LocalUSN, and LocalScanCompleted).</p>

<p>If one of the following conditions is true, then FSAA sends the Tier 2s from the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor Console to the proxy server or applet host:</p>

<ul><li>RemoteGUID is blank</li><li>RemoteGUID is not equal to LocalGUID</li><li>RemoteUSN is not equal to LocalUSN</li><li>RemoteScan is not complete and local Tier 2 is newer than remote Tier 2 (based on TBL_FSAA_StatusScanTime)</li><li>Remote Tier 2s have an older schema version</li></ul>

<p>If sent, FSAA automatically unzips the Tier 2s on the proxy server or applet host. The Tier 2s on the proxy server or applet host are only replaced with Tier 2s from the zip if a Tier 2 from the zip is newer than proxy/applet Tier 2.</p>

<h3>How FSAA Determines if a Scan Should Run</h3>

<p>FSAA first checks for the following conditions:</p>

<ul><li>No Tier 2s exist</li><li>Previous scan was not completed, and Tier 2 databases are older than the value for Restart Incomplete Scan After... (or if it is set to 0)</li><li>Tier 2 databases are older than the value for Rescan Unimported Hosts After... (or if it is set to 0)</li></ul>

<p>If any of the above conditions are met, then FSAA will start a new scan, unless one of the following conditions is met:</p>

<ul><li>Tier 1&#39;s GUID no longer matches Tier 2&#39;s GUID, indicating Tier 1 and Tier 2 databases do not match</li><li>Tier 2&#39;s USN is greater than Tier 1&#39;s USN, indicating there is data for bulk import</li></ul>

<h3>Tier 1 vs. Tier 2 GUID Mismatch</h3>

<p>Tier 1 and Tier 2 databases need to match, as FSAA uses numbers to identify objects such as folders or users. If Tier 1 and Tier 2 GUIDs do not match, FSAA cannot confirm that those numbers represent the same object(s) in Tier 1 and Tier 2 (making the scan data invalid).</p>

<p>If FSAA detects a GUID mismatch upon import, FSAA will throw an error indicating that and provide instructions on how to reset Tier 1. For assistance, contact Stealthbits Support and halt all further actions (support@stealthbits.com, https://www.stealthbits.com/support).</p>

<h3>Moving the Location of the FSAA Folder on Proxy Servers or Applet Hosts</h3>

<ol><li>Move the FSAA folder on the target host to the new location. The location must be within a folder named Netwrix Enterprise Auditor.</li><li>Update the %SAINSTALLDIR% Environment Variable on the target host to point to the new Netwrix Enterprise Auditor folder from the previous step.</li></ol>

<ul><li>To open Environment Variables in Windows, search the Start Menu for Environment Variables and open Edit the System Environment Variables.</li><li>Click Environment Variables near the bottom of the System Properties &gt; Advanced tab.</li><li>Highlight SAINSTALLDIR under System Variables and click Edit.</li></ul>

<p>The default path for %SAINSTALLDIR% is: C:\Program Files (x86)\STEALTHbits\Netwrix Enterprise Auditor\</p>

<p>The FSAA Data Collector references: %SAINSTALLDIR%\..\Netwrix Enterprise Auditor\FSAA</p>

<p>That means it will remove the last folder from the %SAINSTALLDIR% path and will add Netwrix Enterprise Auditor\FSAA (e.g., if %SAINSTALLDIR% is set to D:\Temp, then FSAA Tier 2s will be stored in D:\Netwrix Enterprise Auditor\FSAA in per-host folders).</p>
