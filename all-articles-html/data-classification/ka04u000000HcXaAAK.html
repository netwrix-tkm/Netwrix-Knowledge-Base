    <h1>How to Upgrade a DQS Deployment</h1>
    <p><strong>Before upgrading a DQS it is important to have a few things in place.</strong></p>

<ol><li>Make sure that the installation media is copied to each individual node in the cluster ahead of time, this will speed up the process.</li><li>Ensure that you are using an account that is a local admin on each server in the cluster, using the NDC service account is preferred.</li><li>Ensure that you take a snapshot of each node in the cluster and backup the NDC SQL database, this will provide a backup in case the upgrade runs into issues. Also, it is best practice to upgrade clients sequentially by version number (ie: 5.5.1 &gt; 5.5.2 &gt; 5.5.3).</li></ol>

<h3>Steps to Upgrade</h3>

<ol><li>Stop all three NDC services on each node in the cluster (conceptcollector, conceptindexer, conceptclassifier)</li><li>On the primary node (the original NDC server, also referred to as DQS1), run the installer for the new version as an administrator. Select �next� on each prompt until the installer completes.</li><li>To ensure that the upgrade was a success, open a browser and navigate to the NDC dashboard which is found here by default: (<a href="http://localhost/conceptQS" target="_blank">http://localhost/conceptQS</a>). Ensure that the version and build correspond to the version that you were attempting to upgrade to, if that is the case then you have successfully upgraded the server.</li><li>Repeat steps 2 and 3 for all subsequent nodes in the cluster, upgrading one server at a time and confirming that the upgrade was a success via the browser.</li><li>Once all nodes in the cluster are showing the same version, you have completed the upgrade successfully.</li></ol>
