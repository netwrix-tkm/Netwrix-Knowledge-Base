    <h1>Warning: Indexer Service Has Been Improperly Shutdown</h1>
    <h2>Symptom</h2>

<div>
<p>The following warning appears in Netwrix Data Classification:</p>

<pre class="has-inner-focus">
<code class="lang-Registry">Indexer service has been improperly shutdown.</code></pre>
</div>

<h2>Cause</h2>

<div>
<p>This message occurs if the Indexer service has been forcibly stopped, such as by <b>Task Manager</b> -&gt; <b>End Task,�</b>or via a machine restart.</p>
</div>

<h2>Resolution</h2>

<div>
<p>To identify the root cause of the issue, open the lock files in the lock archive and check the date and time of the last recorded activity:</p>

<ol><li>
	<p>On the computer that hosts Netwrix Data Classification, navigate to the lock archive location.</p>

	<p>The location of the lock archive should be called out in the warning message, but the default location is <em>C:\Program Files\Netwrix\Data Classification\Index\LockArchive</em>.</p>
	</li><li>
	<p>Open the Lock Archive with a text editor, such as�<b>Notepad</b>.</p>
	</li><li>
	<p>Find the date and time of the last recorded activity. This will help you to understand when the indexer was shutdown improperly.</p>
	</li><li>
	<p>Review the <b>Windows Application</b> logs to look for potential causes, such as a machine reboot, and speak to any users who were logged on to the machine at that time and may know what was happening.</p>
	</li><li>
	<p>When the cause has been identified, you can resolve the issue. Use suspended services if your machine did automatic Windows updates.</p>
	</li></ol>
