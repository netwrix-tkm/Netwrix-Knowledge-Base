Resolving Unsupported Locale Error During Upgrade (v4.2.1626 or Higher) Summary When upgrading from a pre-4.2.1626 version of Privilege Secure to a post-4.2.1626 version of Privilege Secure, it is possible that the following error occurs: PostgreSQL is unable to support this locale, please change Windows Regional settings to supported locale. US English is recommended. This would indicate that an unsupported locale is configured, which creates an issue during the migration from Postgres 12 (pre-4.2.1626) to Postgres 16 (4.2.1626 or higher). Instructions The Privilege Secure installer executes theinitdbcommand as part of the migration to Postgres 16. In order for this command to succeed, the user who is executinginitdb�must have regional settings enabled that correspond to a locale supported by Postgres 16. To resolve this issue, ensure that during upgrade, you are logged in as a user whose locale settings are �English (United States)� (en-US). Then proceed with the upgrade as usual.
