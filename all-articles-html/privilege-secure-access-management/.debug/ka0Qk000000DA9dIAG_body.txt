Creating a Custom BYOV Connector to Check out Service Accounts from Privilege Secure Summary Thestandard BYOV connector for checking out credentials from Privilege Secure�will, by design, not allow service accounts with the "Internal" managed type to be checked out. If this functionality is business-critical, this article provides a means for "Internal" type service accounts to be checked out using a BYOV connector.Note: As service accounts are by nature critical, we advise that the day-to-day use of these accounts for Privilege Secure sessions be minimized.Note: This connector will not rotate the account's password during the checkout script.
