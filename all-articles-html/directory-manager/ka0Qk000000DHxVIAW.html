    <h1>How To Create Orphan Group Update Schedule</h1>
    <h4><b>Applies To:</b></h4>
<p>GroupID 11</p>
<h4><b>Business Requirement:</b></h4>
<p>We have multiple groups in GroupID who used to have a primary owner assigned to them as well as additional owner(s). However, their primary owner field was emptied out because either someone removed it manually or primary owner�s AD accounts got deleted from AD after they left. Can we auto-assign a primary owner to such groups?</p>
<h4><b>More Information:</b></h4>
<p>Such groups are called orphan groups in GroupID. We can create and schedule an �Orphan Group Update� job, which is responsible for assigning a primary owner to groups that do not have one. For this, the orphan group must have at least one additional owner, since the job promotes a group�s additional owner as its primary owner.</p>
<p>When an Orphan Group Update job is run, the first additional owner in the additional owners� list (be it a user, contact, or security group) is promoted as the primary owner, and a notification is sent to the promoted owner. In case of a security group being promoted as the primary owner, a notification is sent to all members of the group.</p>
<h4><b>Solution:</b></h4>
<ol start="1"><li>In the GroupID Admin Center, select�<b>Identity Stores &gt; </b>Then on your target Identity Store click on the 3 dots button to edit it<b>.</b></li></ol>

<p>�</p>
<ol start="2"><li>�On the next page, scroll down and select <b>Schedules</b>. Then click on the <b>Add Schedule</b> button and select <b>Orphan Group Update Job</b>. �</li></ol>

<ol start="3"><li>Under <b>Schedule Name</b>, give a unique name for the schedule. Under <b>Targets,</b> click on the <b>Add Container</b> button and select the OU on which this job should run. Select a GroupID portal URL in the�<b>Portal URL</b>�drop-down list to include it in notifications generated by the schedule. Users are redirected to this portal to perform any necessary actions. In the�<b>Scheduler Service Name</b> drop-down list, select a Scheduler service that would be responsible for triggering this schedule. The number of services displayed in the list depends on the number of Elasticsearch clusters in the environment. Click�<b>Add Triggers</b>�in the�<b>Triggers</b> area to specify a triggering criterion for the schedule that, when met, starts the execution of the schedule. Click�<b>Add Authentication</b>�in the�<b>Authentication</b> area to specify an account for running the schedule in the identity store. Finally, click on the <b>Create Schedule</b> button.</li></ol>

<ol start="4"><li>Whenever this schedule is executed, it will search for any groups (inside the OU defined in the schedule only) that do not have a primary owner but do have additional owner(s) and will promote them as an owner.</li></ol>
