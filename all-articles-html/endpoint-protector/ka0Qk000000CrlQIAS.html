    <h1>[UPDATE]- Spectre and Meltdown. What to know as an Endpoint Protector user.</h1>
    <p>Meltdown (Rogue Data Cache Load/CVE-2017-5754) and Spectre (Bounds Check Bypass; CVE-2017-5753, Branch Target Injection / BTI; CVE-2017-5715) are vulnerabilities found on processors.</p>
<p>They can be exploited by malicious applications run locally on those processors/computers. As of this post writing today 9-Feb-2018 there are no reported cases of Meltdown and Spectre being exploited in the wild.</p>
<p>As an Endpoint Protector customer you are indirectly affected by Spectre and Meltdown. Endpoint Protector (the server part) is running usually as a Virtual Appliance or as an Endpoint Protector Hardware Appliance.</p>
<p>In the case:</p>
<p>- If you use an Endpoint Protector Hardware Appliances please contact our support team and they will assist you to apply the latest patches to the Ubuntu Operating System.</p>
<p>- If you use an Endpoint Protector Virtual Appliance please patch your hypervisor (such as Vmware EXSi, etc.) so it addresses these vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>- For your Endpoints on which you are running the Endpoint Protector Agent/Client follow the update procedures by the Operating System makers to address these vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>Please note Operating Systems like Ubuntu have released a number of patches to address these vulnerabilities and keep adding and changing patches.</p>
<p>Here some more details how Ubuntu is addressing these vulnerabilities:</p>
