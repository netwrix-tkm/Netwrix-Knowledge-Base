    <meta name="assignmentnote" content="Hi Ian,

We are assigning this draft for you to work on. Please reach out if you have any questions. 

The article should be revised into the Symptom/Cause/Resolution structure. The steps for correcting the host list for the job should also be described in detail. You may coordinate with Josh for this information who should still have access to the ticket&#x27;s recording. 

Thanks for your help!">
