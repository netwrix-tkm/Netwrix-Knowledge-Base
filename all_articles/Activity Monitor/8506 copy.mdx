## Symptom

You have encountered the following Cannot Find Process error in the Netwrix Threat Prevention logs:

Failed loading monitor dll:

C:\Program Files\STEALTHbits\StealthINTERCEPT\SIWindowsAgent\SI.ActiveDirectoryMonitor.dll, status: CannotFindProcess

When attempting to create a dump of LSASS.exe via Task Manager on the affected domain controller, it fails or creates a 0-kb file. If the dump creation succeeds, it does not indicate that SIWindowsAgent.exe is not blocked, only that Taskmgr.exe is allowed to access LSASS.exe.

## Cause

Endpoint protection is hiding the LSASS.exe process from SIWindowsagent.exe or otherwise blocking the hook into the LSASS API. Common EPP solutions include CarbonBlack, Cylance, and CrowdStrike.

## Resolution

In the endpoint protection configuration, allow SIWindowsAgent.exe and the contents of the SIAgent install directory access to LSASS.exe. Refer to the following default folder:

C:\Program Files\STEALTHBits\StealthINTERCEPT\SIWindowsAgent

Refer to the following article for additional information on recommended exclusions for your antivirus and endpoint protection solutions: Installation — Antivirus Software Considerations · v7.3.
