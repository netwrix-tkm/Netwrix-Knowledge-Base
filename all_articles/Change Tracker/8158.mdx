## Symptom

When attempting to connect a device to the Netwrix Change Tracker, the following error message may appear in the rolling log:

2017-08-15 16:29:41,627 [10] INFO Message - Hub connection failed (500 Server message: Error, requested Agent name is in use by device with uniqueId: 123456a6-ffee-78a9-927e-34921d59ce64)

## Cause

This problem occurs when a device that has the same name as an already registered agent attempts to connect to the __Netwrix Change Tracker__. When an agent connects, it receives an identifier called the __agent.id__ file, which contains an alphanumeric ID for identification purposes. If the ".id" file is not located in the Agent Directory (%ProgramData%\\NNT\\gen7agent.service or /var/nnt/gen7agent.service), you will see an error in the Agent's __Rolling-log.txt__ similar to the one above.

>

> __IMPORTANT: __This method should only be used to resolve this problem if the Agent you are trying to connect is the same device or a re-imaged variant of the older device. Contact Netwrix Change Tracker Support before attempting this fix.

>

## Resolution

#### For Windows-Based OS

Follow these steps:

* Stop the Netwrix Change Tracker gen7agent Service.
  * Open the rolling log and copy the Agent ID that is listed. Example: Hub connection failed (500 Error, requested Agent name is in use by device with uniqueId: 123456a6-ffee-78a9-927e-34921d59ce64).

* Edit the __agent.id__ file in %ProgramData%\\NNT\\gen7agent.service using Notepad.

* Erase the ID that is currently in that file and paste in the ID copied from the rolling log above. Ensure there are no spaces at the beginning or end of the text string.

* Delete all files within the %ProgramData%\\NNT\\gen7agent.service folder except the __Hubdetails.xml__ and __agent.id__ file.

* Edit the __Hubdetails.xml__ file and erase the `` <E1> `` tags and everything in between them.

* Replace the `` <Password /> `` entry in the hubdetails with `` <Password>passWord121</Password> ``.>

>     <span class="Note">__NOTE: __</span>__passWord121__ is the default agent password. If you have changed the default password, use the updated password instead.

>

* If you have specified a Prefix or Suffix and would like to remove it, replace `` <NamePrefix>MyPrefix</NamePrefix> `` with `` <NamePrefix /> ``.

* Save the __Hubdetails.xml__. You may need to save it to your desktop and copy it back to the original location due to hardened permissions.

* Start the gen7agent Service. The new device should now be registered using its original device name.

#### For RHEL/CentOS Linux-Based OS

Follow these steps:

* Stop the Netwrix Change Tracker gen7agent Service.
  * Open the rolling log using <code class="lang-Registry">cat</code>, <code class="lang-Registry">nano</code>, or <code class="lang-Registry">vi</code> (<code class="lang-Registry">cat/vi/nano/var/nnt/gen7agent.service/rolling-log.txt</code>). Copy the Agent ID that is listed.

* Edit the __agent.id__ file in <code class="lang-Registry">/var/nnt/gen7agent.service/agent.id</code> using <code class="lang-Registry">nano</code> or <code class="lang-Registry">vi</code>.

* Erase the ID that is currently in that file and paste in the ID copied from the rolling log above. Ensure there are no spaces at the beginning or end of the text string.

* Delete all files except the __Hubdetails.xml__ and __agent.id__ file within the <code class="lang-Registry">/var/nnt/gen7agent.service</code> folder.

* Edit the __Hubdetails.xml__ file and erase the `` <E1> `` tags and everything in between them.

* Replace the `` <Password /> `` entry in the hubdetails with `` <Password>passWord121</Password> ``.>

>     <span class="Note">__NOTE: __</span>__passWord121__ is the default agent password. If you have changed the default password, use the updated password instead.

>

* If you have specified a Prefix or Suffix and would like to remove it, replace `` <NamePrefix>MyPrefix</NamePrefix> `` with `` <NamePrefix /> ``.

* Save the __Hubdetails.xml__.

* Start the nntgen7agent Service. The new device should now be registered using its original device name.
