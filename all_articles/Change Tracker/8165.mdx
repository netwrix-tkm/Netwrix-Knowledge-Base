Installing Gen 7 Agent for Windows

___Note: Microsoft .NET Framework 4.5 is required – Enable this using ‘Roles/Features’ – ‘Add Features’ or download the ______official Microsoft installer from  ______https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/download/details.aspx?id=30653___

User-Attended Gen 7 Agent .exe installer

The Hub API page must be entered together with Access Credentials

By default the Agent username is ‘agent’ with password ‘passWord121’ but these can be changed via User Settings

By default the Agent will register using the Name of the server but there is an opportunity to customize this during installation (or post-installation via an edit of the [Hub Details file](#_Check_Agent_Operation) – see more here)

During installation this can also be performed using the Advanced Configuration stage of the exe installation, and there is also an option to test agent connectivity (strongly recommended)

__\*IMPORTANT\* __In order to maximize performance, Gen 7 Agent operational files are located in %PROGRAMDATA%\\NNT\\gen7agent.service, so if you need to edit the HubDetails.xml file for the Agent this is where the file can be found, similarly if you are ever required to provide a rolling-log.txt file to Netwrix Support this is where it is located.

Gen 7 Agent UI

A local UI for the Gen 7 Agent provides visibility of operation for troubleshooting purposes. It is available from the hosting platform e.g. http://localhost:8096 and requires credentials of username ‘admin’ and password ‘password’

Scripted/Command Line use of Gen 7 Agent .exe installer

By co-locating a pre-configured HubDetails.xml file in the same folder as the Gen 7 Agent installer these details will be used by the installer for the installed agent

Use of the /SP- /VERYSILENT /SUPPRESSMSGBOXES switches will ensure the installation is silent and operates unattended.

Alternatively, a full command line installation can be used, with individual arguments used to specify HubDetails settings.

For example –

Full details of HubDetails.xml nodes and their settings can be found here

Installing Gen 7 Agent for Linux

Using local RPM files

Netwrix Gen 7 Agent can also be installed on Linux and Unix platforms. In a similar way to the Windows Agent, the Agent requires a runtime and an Agent executable. For Linux, the runtime is Mono, the open source parallel to Microsoft .NET.

Installation simply requires the Netwrix-Mono and Netwrix-Gen7 Agent RPMs to be installed as follows

Once installed, the HubDetails.xml file must be configured – this can be done directly by editing a HubDetails.xml on the /var/nnt/gen7agent.service path or by using the /opt/nnt/gen7agent//configure-gen7agent.sh script.

The Agent service can then be started using

Scripted installation of Gen 7 Agent RPM installer

The entire process outlined above can be completed using a single command as follows

(___Note:___ Removal __rpm -evv nnt-mono-4.6.1-5.x86\_64 nnt-changetracker-gen7agent-7.0.0.15-7.noarch)__

For Debian Linux

Netwrix provide packages for Debian distributions so please download the relevant Gen 7 Agent package then install using:

You can then use the same steps for [configuring your HubDetails.xml file as in the previous section](#_Using_local_RPM).

Note: To uninstall the Gen 7 Agent on Debian, use

You’ll then want to remove the Netwrix Gen 7 Agent files which will be found at

Gen 7 Agent UI

A local UI for the Gen 7 Agent provides visibility of operation for troubleshooting purposes. It is available from the hosting platform e.g. http://localhost:8096 and requires credentials of username ‘admin’ and password ‘password’

Troubleshooting Connectivity

Check Agent Operation

For any agent on any platform there is a local agent status interface which can be viewed via the local web browser at http://localhost:8096

If the Agent UI is not available, then it is likely that the agent service is stopped/has failed.

Windows – Check Task Manager and Services Console

Linux – service nntGen7agent status

The below shows that the agent service is running correctly but it has been unable to register with the

Change Tracker Hub.

The Agent should report the URL for the Hub it is registered as in the green pop-out boxes

If the Hub URL referenced is not correct, you can edit the HubDetails.xml file and correct this. Likewise, the Agent username and password settings can be reset by editing this file.

Windows - C:\\ProgramData\\NNT\\gen7agent.service\\HubDetails.xml

Linux - /var/nnt/gen7agent.service/HubDetails.xml

The HubDetails.xml File

The Agent configuration settings are controlled by the Hub during operations but the initial registration necessitates a basic config file for registration with the Hub.

The HubDetails.xml file includes some details unique to your deployment of Change Tracker Gen 7, hence it requiring your intervention to make sure settings are as needed.

The key tags within the file are as follows:

___Note___: An unencrypted password means the Agent didn’t initialize and suggests a bad installation or .NET Framework issue – remember the Agent on Windows requires .NET Framework V3.5, Linux/Solaris requires the latest Netwrix Mono runtime.

___Note___: Netwrix’s Gen 7 Agent also supports additional nodes – NamePrefix, NameSuffix

\*The Thumbprint uniquely identifies the Web Server certificate, see more here https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms734695(v=vs.110).aspx

              Open II

              Select the server from the list on the left hand sid

              Select Server Certificate

              Double click your certificate in the list to open the certificates permission

              Open the Details ta

              Scroll to the bottom of the list and highlight the Thumbprint fiel

              The thumbprint value will then be displayed – transpose this to your HubDetails.xml file

The next step is to check that there is network connectivity to the Hub URL from the Agent’s host

NOTE: Where the Change Tracker Hub has been installed on a Windows/IIS platform then the Hub URL will be https://192.168.1.36

Finally, the Agent will maintain a rolling-log of its activityGen 7 Agent – Rolling Log File

Windows - C:\\ProgramData\\NNT\\gen7agent.service\\rolling-log.txt

Linux - /var/nnt/gen7agent.service/rolling-log.txt

This will also provide diagnostic information if the agent is not functioning correctly.

Finally – Please contact support if you need help at any stage
