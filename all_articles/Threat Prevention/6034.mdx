Symptom

After upgrading the Threat Prevention 7.3.5 all agents are in an unknown state.

If you try to disable hardening or anything similar in this state you may also get an error along the lines of "_Failed to stop service 'SIWindowsAgent'. Error: Provider failure"._

Problem

When installing the newer version on Threat Prevention the installer did not automatically detect the previous version's root.dat file. This is most commonly the result of installing the new version to a different path than that of the previous version.

Solution

1.

Copy the root.dat from the old installation location to SIEnterpriseManager/CertsInfo folder

2.

Enable the Pre-7.3.5 port for the port used previously (default of 3739) in the SIEnterpriseManager.exe.config

Further information on mixed version mode and the different configuration options can be foundÂ here.
