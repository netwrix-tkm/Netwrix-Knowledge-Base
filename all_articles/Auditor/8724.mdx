## Symptom

A client does not show up in the MSP Portal for the MSP.

## Resolution

Follow these troubleshooting steps before reaching out to the Channel Team:

Check communication with the license server. Search the %Working Folder%\Logs\Administrative Console log for the following line:

Start web request to https://license.nwxcorp.com/msp/licensecount.php

The following HttpWebResponse StatusCode line should resolve to OK.Add the following structure to the MSP.xml file located at C:\Program Files\Netwrix Auditor\Administrative Console\MSP.xml:

CompanyABCServer

-->

-->

Note: The  attribute is supported starting with version 10.7. It is used to omit unnecessary Entra ID accounts from being counted in the license counter for the Entra ID (Azure AD collector).

Use the structure with the relevant customer paths and Entra ID accounts. Once saved, run Netwrix.CallHome.MSPTool.exe located at C:\Program Files\Netwrix Auditor\Administrative Console\Netwrix.NAC.MSPTool.exe.Check the HKLM\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Netwrix Auditor\Management Console registry key for the MSPErrorDateMarker value containing the failure time. This value is registered if the sender fails to transfer license usage information to the server. If data has not been sent after three days, the following error will be written to the Netwrix Auditor System Health Windows event log:

Source: Notification Sender.

Error text:

Your license is out of compliance.

Netwrix Auditor was unable to check your license online due to the following error: {0}.

Check your firewall settings to allow access to https://www.netwrix.com or contact Netwrix Technical Support.

If no error is present after completing the provided steps, it is possible that license data is not being associated correctly to the MSP. Contact the Channel Team at netwrix.msp@netwrix.com for assistance.
