## 3. Raising log level

The default log level is INFO. Messages logged at this level are optimized to troubleshoot the basic issues. You can enable other log levelsâ€”these are DBG, DBG2, DBG3 (i.e., from less verbose to more verbose). Changing the required log level may be requested by the R&D team to get additional information. Refer to the following steps to change the log level:

Stop the target service. See the Table 3.

Edit the MaxSeverity setting in the corresponding file. See the Table 4.

Start the target service.
