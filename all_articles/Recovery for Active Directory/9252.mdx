## Symptom

In the Forest page in Netwrix Recovery for Active Directory, the Server Backup History table lists a queued session that does not start.

## Causes

Review the list of possible causes:

A service connection point is not published.

The Recovery Server Backup Agent failed to install.

Netwrix Recovery for Active Directory encountered an issue during the backup process.

The Recovery Server port (9001 by default) is closed for inbound communication.

Your Netwrix Recovery for Active Directory license has expired.

## Resolution

Refer to the following steps to remove the queued session from the list:

In your SQL Server Management Studio instance, locate the Netwrix Recovery for Active Directory database. The default name is NetwrixRecovery.

Right-click the NetwrixRecovery database and run a new query to output all records of the Server Backup History table:

SELECT * FROM ServerBackupHistory

Locate the entry with NULL in the EndTime column. Record the corresponding ID value.

Run a new query to remove the queued entry:

DELETE FROM ServerBackupHistory WHERE ID = '%targetID%'

Refresh the Forest page in Netwrix Recovery for Active Directory to confirm the query is deleted.
