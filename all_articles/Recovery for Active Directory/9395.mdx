## Question

Can you reset multi-factor authentication (MFA) in Netwrix Recovery for Active Directory (NRAD) after losing access to their authenticator account?

## Answer

Yes, you can reset MFA in NRAD by following the outlined steps below:

Open SQL Server Management Studio and connect to the SQL Server instance used for NRAD.

Expand the Tables in the database used by NRAD. The default database name is NetwrixRecovery.

NOTE: The default database name may vary if it was modified during the installation of NRAD.

Right-click the dbo.tusers table and select Edit Top 200 Rows.

Locate the user account by identifying their login name in the Data column.

Change the TwoFactorEnabled column value from True to False and save the changes.

After resetting MFA, users can log in to the console without an authenticator code. To re-enable MFA, refer to the steps in the Configure MFA guide.
