__Summary:__ Useful Dell Isilon / PowerScale Activity commands when troubleshooting activity sync issues.

__Issue:__ When investigating an issue into why events are not up to date in Activity Monitor console/Logs it is beneficial to be able to view from a SSH session to the ISILON / PowerScale what the current state of audit logs are.  Starting withOneFS 8.0.1, Dell introduced several commands that assist in viewing the audit log process. A few of these commands are listed below with explanations on usage.

__Instructions:__ AUDIT LOG PROGRESS:

To check the last captured audit event and the event time of the last event to be sent to the CEE server, run the

__isi audit progress view__ command to view the forwarder log position of the CEE server. The command shows the times for the node the command is run on.

A sample output of the isi audit progress view is shown:

Protocol Audit Log Time: Tue Mar 29 13:32:38 2016

Protocol Audit Cee Time: Tue Mar 29 13:32:38 2016

Protocol Audit Syslog Time: Fri Mar 25 17:00:28 2016

___ ___

The output for Audit Log Time and Audit Cee Time are the ones we are interested in and should match or at least be close to matching.

You can use __isi\_for\_array __ to gather the time for all nodes in the cluster. Example command: __isi\_for\_array isi audit progress view__

Additionally you can target particular nodes by using --__INN____. __Example command: __isi audit progress view --Inn=2__ this will display the stats for logical node 2.

In 8.0.1 a new command was introduced to get a global view of the oldest __Unsent__ protocol audit event for the cluster. Command: __ ____isi audit progress global view____. __If the Oldest Audit Cee time is months behind the Audit Log this shows the oldest log __STILL __to be sent to the CEE.

Sample output:

Protocol Audit Latest Log Time: Fri Sep 2 10:06:36 2016

Protocol Audit Oldest Cee Time: Fri Sep 2 10:02:28 2016

Protocol Audit Oldest Syslog Time: Fri Sep 2 10:02:28 2016

___ ___

AUDIT LOG TIME ADJUSTMENT:

In a scenario where auditing on the cluster has been configured and enabled prior to setting up CEE and/or Syslog, the cluster will attempt to forward all events from the time auditing was configured.

OneFS provides a configuration setting to manually update the time to begin forwarding events from. By setting the --__cee-log-time__, you can advance the point of time from where to start to forward.

Example: The following will update the pointer to forward events after Nov 19, 2023 at 2pm

__isi audit settings global modify --cee-log-time "Protocol@2023-11-19 14:00:00"__

__ __

The ability to "check point or book mark" a date in time is especially useful when seeing a very large backlog of events.

Note: doubled hyphens (--) used in the commands above are required.
