## Applies To

Directory Manager 11

## Overview

This article explains how to display nested (transitive) group ownership on the __My Groups__ page in Netwrix Directory Manager (formerly GroupID) 11. By default, nested ownership is not shown in the Self-Service Portal, but you can enable this feature using an advanced setting.

Some groups in Active Directory are owned by a security group. You may want members of the owner group to see their owned groups on the __My Groups__ page. For example, if User A is a member of Group A, and Group A is the owner of Group B, then User A is considered the owner of Group B through nested (transitive) ownership.

## Instructions

* In the Directory Manager Admin Center, select __Applications__. Under __Directory Manager Portal__, select the __three dots__ button for your portal, then click __Settings__.

On the Server Settings tab, click Advanced Settings. Select Listings Display, then enable the Display Nested Ownership option.
