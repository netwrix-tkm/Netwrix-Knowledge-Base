## Applies To

Directory Manager 11

## Overview

This article explains how to configure the default sort attribute for search results in the Directory Manager User Portal. By default, search results are sorted by theÂ __displayName__ attribute, but you can change this to another attribute, such as __department__, to better suit your business requirements.

## Instructions

* In the Directory Manager Admin Center, go to __Applications__. For the application or portal where you want to change the setting, click the three dots and select __Settings__.

Click Advanced Settings. In the right pane, find the Sort Search option and select your desired sort attribute from the drop-down menu.

Scroll down and click Save to apply your changes.

## Impact

This setting applies to listings on the All Groups, My Groups, and Users pages, as well as searches performed using Advanced Search and the Find dialog box. After applying the setting, results are sorted by the specified attribute in ascending order.

>

> __NOTE: __If the attribute you select for sorting is not available as a column header in the listing or search results, Directory Manager will default to sorting by __displayName__.
