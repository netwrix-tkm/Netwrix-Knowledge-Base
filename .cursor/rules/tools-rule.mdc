description: This rule helps when calling the 'edit_file' tool fails by breaking complex changes into smaller, sequential steps for better success rates, particularly for large-scale edits.

- When using the tool 'edit_file', break edits into smaller, focused changes of no more than 20-30 lines each.
- If an edit_file operation fails, immediately retry with a smaller change scope.
- For complex multi-part edits, make changes sequentially and wait for user confirmation between steps.
- When editing system-critical files, first develop a clear outline of changes, then implement them in small chunks.

- Never attempt to update multiple distinct sections of a file in a single edit operation.
