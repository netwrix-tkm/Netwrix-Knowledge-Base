# Configuring Netwrix Activity Monitor to Send to Threat Manager

 The Netwrix Activity Monitor (SAM) can be configured to send events to Threat Manager (SD).

If Threat Prevention (SI) is configured to send events to SAM, those events will be passed on to whatever applications SAM is configured to send events to.

To send events to Threat Manager:

In Threat Manager:
	* Navigate to the
 Integrations page.

* Click the
 Add New Integration button.

Set the Type field to App Token, enter a Name, and (optionally) a Description.

* Click the
 Add button.

Expand the App Tokens node on the Integrations tree and * select the
 App Token you just generated.

* Click the
 Copy Token button.

In the Netwrix Activity Monitor:
	Go to the Monitored Domains tab, * click Add
 Output and * select the
 Threat Manager option.

Set the value of the Server in SERVER[:PORT] format field to [DEFENDHOST]:10001, where [DEFENDHOST] is the hostname or IP address of the Threat Manager host.

Paste the App Token generated in Threat Manager into the App Token field.

* Click the
 OK button.
