## Overview

This article covers steps to take when upgrading Netwrix Password Policy Enforcer (PPE) in your environment.

## Instructions

Refer to the following steps to take to complete the PPE upgrade:

After you upgrade the PPE Server installation in one domain controller (DC), select No when a reboot is prompted.

Run the PPE Configuration tool on the DC. Upon the launch, the upgraded PPE Server instance imports the configuration.

Import the PPE licenseâ€”in the PPS Properties menu, select the License tab and import the license.

Allow the Active Directory replication to replicate the configuration settings to all DCs in the domain.

Reboot the DC with the updated PPE instance.

Upgrade and reboot other DCs.

NOTE: Once you complete the steps provided above, you can upgrade the PPE client installations.
