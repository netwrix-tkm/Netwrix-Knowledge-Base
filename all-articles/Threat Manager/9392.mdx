## Symptom

When attempting to access the `` NTDS.dit `` file on a domain controller, the expected threat event does not trigger in Netwrix Threat Manager.

## Cause

By default, the `` NTDS.dit `` event in Netwrix Threat Prevention only tracks one domain controller. If the file is accessed from a system other than the one being tracked by default, the event is not captured or forwarded to Threat Manager.

## Resolution

To resolve the issue, add all domains and systems to be tracked:

* Navigate to the policy settings in Threat Prevention.
  * Select __Event Type__ > __Additional Agents__ > __Add All Agents and Domains__.
