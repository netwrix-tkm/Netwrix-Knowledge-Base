## Symptom

When generating and exporting larger CSV and XLSX reports in Netwrix Data Classification, the resulting report file does not contain all the documents. The report may also be reported as corrupted.

## Cause

In case of an exceptionally large report, the export times out. Reports containing 1 million documents and more are affected. This is a known issue reported in v5.7.2.15.

## Resolution

Split the large report into smaller reports.
