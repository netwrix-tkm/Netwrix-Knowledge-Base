If you attempt to:

Step 1 – Pre-set the file associations in the image or

Step 2 – Set using Group Policy via the "Set a default associations configuration file" or

Step 3 – Attempt to set it using MDM…

Then that method will WIN over PolicyPak File Associations Manager, and you will not get the PolicyPak File Associations Manager benefits.

Therefore, use ONLY PolicyPak File Associations Manager and not the above methods to achieve File Associations goals. Remove any in-box Group Policy settings, etc, which are attempting to set File Associations and use only PolicyPak to do it.
