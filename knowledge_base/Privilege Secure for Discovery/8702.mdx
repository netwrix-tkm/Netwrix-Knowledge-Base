## Question

How to transfer files to Linux servers via Secure Shell using Netwrix Privelege Secure as a proxy?

## Answer

Any secure copy protocol client using SSH will work (e.g., WinSCP, MobaXterm, etc.) â€” refer to the following steps done in WinSCP for reference:

The general SCP command is scp @:/target. You can use it for Direct Connect.

stands for ADuser + activity + targethost.

stands for npsroxy:4422. In case you don't have a dedicated proxy server, use localhost to indicate the NPS host.

Create a new session in WinSCP using the following credentials:

Host name: NPS Proxy Server (localhost).

Port: 4422.

User name: aduser + activity + targethost.

Run the session to be able to use file transfer.
