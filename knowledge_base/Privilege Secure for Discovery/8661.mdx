Formerly SecureONE

# Symptom

When attempting to scan an endpoint the following error occurs:

9999 Mismatch in service account username when attempting to rotate service password

The scan will not complete.

# Cause

It is a bug related to the Local Admin Password TTL Days. This is an older feature that supported rotating local account passwords which is no longer supported/leveraged. We have set this to 0 in all installations/upgrades moving forward.

# Resolution

Update the Local Admin Password TTL Days to 0 for the respective service

Restart the service via the UI
