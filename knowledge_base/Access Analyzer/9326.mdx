## Symptom

The File System Scan completes with the following error message:

Error: A connection attempt failed because the connected party did not properly respond after a period of time, or the established connection failed because connected host has failed to respond IP:87xx

## Cause

A third-party security tool or firewall rule is blocking the needed ports (8767 and 8766) for the File System Scan to function correctly.

## Resolution

Netwrix Access Analyzer server needs to communicate with the audited host via ports 8767 and 8766 as shown below. You may refer to the following PowerShell commands, but ensure to replace 2019dc with your needed host name:

$RPC_host= 'REPLACE-WITH-YOUR-PROXY-HOST'

Test-NetConnection -ComputerName $RPC_host -Port 8766 -InformationLevel Detailed

Test-NetConnection -ComputerName $RPC_host -Port 8767 -InformationLevel Detailed

If the test connections are successful on both ports, then the error should not appear.If the test connections fail, verify that the proxy is installed and running at that location.

If the proxy is not installed, then ensure it is installed and running following these steps: File System Proxy Service Installation.If the proxy is installed and running, then the environment must either have a firewall or other security software preventing communication on ports 8767 and 8766.
