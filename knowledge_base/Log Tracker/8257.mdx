## Question

How to create a report for a specific time frame in Netwrix Log Tracker?

## Answer

Refer to the following steps:

Navigate to Reports > Query > Run Report.

Select the appropriate query file type for your search. E.g., to create a report on user activity, select Archive.

In the Start Date field, you can specify the latest report date. To limit the report scope, you can use the Span Days field.

To change the amount of max entries in the report, edit the Query Max Results field value.

The Match Expression field allows to specify an expression to report on. E.g., to run a report on user activity, specify the user: expression.

Alternatively, you can use Reports > Graphs to get a visual representation of activity depending on the graph type and parameters set up. When you click a graph bar in the Graphs view, a separate All Messages for Selected Time view opens to allow you to either browse activity or specify search parameters to run a new search query.

To better organize the search process, you can create a Thread via Correlation > Threads.
