## Question

Can you migrate audit databases to another Microsoft SQL Server instance?

## Answer

Yes, you are able to migrate audit databases to another Microsoft SQL Server instance. Follow the steps below to complete this process.

#### Prerequisite

  Required Permissions: The account used by Netwrix Auditor must have __db\_owner__ rights on the target audit databases. For SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS), the account must have the __Content Manager__ role on the Home folder, and users must have the __Browser__ role on the Report Server. For detailed steps on assigning these permissions, see Requirements – SQL Server Reporting Services · v10.7

  SQL Server and SSRS must be installed and configured on the new server.

#### Instructions

* Configure a new SQL Server instance.
  * On the Netwrix Auditor server, stop Netwrix Auditor Archive Service and Netwrix Auditor Management Service.

* Back up all Netwrix databases in the old SQL Server instance except for __Netwrix\_CommonDB__, __Netwrix\_ImportDB__, __Netwrix\_Auditor\_EventLog__, __ReportServer__, and __ReportServerTempDB__. To back up databases:

* Open __Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio__ and connect to the original SQL Server instance.
  * Select an __audit database__, right-click it, and select __Tasks__ > __Back Up...__

* In the __Back Up Database__ window, review the path where the database backup will be stored in the __Destination__ section.

* Copy the database backups to your new SQL Server. In the new __SQL Server__ instance:

* Open __Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio__ and connect to the destination SQL Server instance.
  * Right-click the __Databases__ node and select __Restore Database...__

* Under the __Source__ section, select the __Device__ option, and click __...__ to browse for databases.

* In the __Specify Backup Devices__ window, click __Add__ and select the backup database file. Click __OK__.

* Specify the database name and check the __Restore__ checkbox under the __Backup sets to restore__ section.

* Deploy the new Report Database. For more information, see Deploying the Report Server Database.

* Stop the old __SQL Server (%instance\_name%)__ service.

* Start Netwrix Auditor Archive Service and Netwrix Auditor Management Service.

* In the main Netwrix Auditor menu, select __Settings__ > __Audit Database__ tab, and specify the new SQL Server and Reporting Service settings.

* Click __Yes__ when the following message appears: ![Confirmation dialog: Data will become unavailable until the new database is configured](https://nwxcorp.file.force.com/servlet/rtaImage?eid=ka0Qk000000DtI1&feoid=00N0g000004CA0p&refid=0EMQk000001mFc5)

* In the main Netwrix Auditor menu, select __Settings__ > __Investigations__ tab. Click __Modify__ to specify the new SQL Server settings.

* Run a search with the filter __When | Equals | Last 7 days__. If you see the relevant data, the databases were migrated successfully and the new SQL Server is being used.

* __Optional:__ Start the old SQL Server instance if it is used for any other tasks.
