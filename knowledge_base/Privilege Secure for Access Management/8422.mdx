# Overview

This article explains the initial configuration of PostgreSQL high availability (HA) for Netwrix Privilege Secure (NPS) using NPS.HaMgr.exe (NPS HA Configuration Tool). This article also includes steps to upgrade an existing HA server pair, and to upgrade remote service nodes. The NPS.HaMgr.exe tool is available in the Extras folder of the NPS download directory. This implementation of HA is active/passive—in case of a primary server outage, a manual failover is required to switch to the secondary database. All applications and services remain active on corresponding servers; however, both write only to the primary database.

NOTE: In case the primary server becomes unavailable and failover is required, refer to the Upgrade an Existing NPS High Availability (HA) Pair section steps.

IMPORTANT: Before configuring HA, perform the following steps on both primary and secondary NPS servers:

Open the HA tool. Click the folder icon to the right of the PgDataDir path to open the Postgres folder.

Locate the Archive folder. Delete the contents of the Archive folder.

IMPORTANT: Users should use the primary NPS server after establishing the HA pair. The database on the secondary server runs in read-only mode in the HA pair.

IMPORTANT: A reboot will be required on all NPS servers for both initial installations and upgrades.

HA Troubleshooting

Initial Configuration

Perform the following steps to configure an HA pair.

Verify both 5432 (PostgreSQL) and 6500 (NPS Web Services) ports are open between the servers.

If either of the ports was modified, open the corresponding port instead.

The HA tool creates exclusion rules for Windows Firewall, but your network firewall may still block these ports.

Copy the HA tool from the Extras folder to the following folder on both primary and secondary servers:

C:\Program Files\Stealthbits\PAM\HA Tools

If required, replace the default installation path with a custom one.

Run the HA tool on the primary server?specify the primary server IP in the Primary IP field. Allow the tool to process the IP to then fill the Port value. A green checkmark appears in the Primary Node section.

IMPORTANT: The Primary IP field only registers IP addresses. The field does not register FQDNs or localhost (127.0.0.1).

Specify the secondary server IP in the Secondary IP field. Specify the Port value (5432 by default for PostgreSQL). After specifying the values, click any white space in the window of the HA tool to process the secondary IP and port.

IMPORTANT: Some errors and warnings can be ignored during the initial setup:

The %Secondary_IP% not found in pg_hba.conf error indicates no established connection between the PostgreSQL databases. This behavior is expected.

The Firewall Port Not Open warning does not get updated after the HA tool creates a firewall rule.

IMPORTANT: Do not proceed to the next step until both servers have a green check mark in the HA Manager.

Follow the instructions in this article to export the encryption keys from the primary server to the secondary server: How to Configure Encryption Keys in Multiple NPS Server Environments.On the primary server, locate the appsettings.json file at C:\ProgramData\Stealthbits\PAM\HA\appsettings.conf - copy this to the same path on the secondary server.

Run the HA tool on the secondary server. Specify the Primary IP, Primary Port, and Secondary IP.

IMPORTANT: The HA tool might prompt errors and warnings after you enter the values. This behavior is expected.Do not update or refresh any of the fields.

Close the HA tool on both the primary and secondary servers.

Run the HA tool on the primary server and verify the IP address and port fields. Click Update in the Secondary Node section to update the pg_hba.conf file.

Run the HA tool on the secondary server. Allow the tool to initialize—a Configure HA Secondary button should appear in the top right corner of the tool window.

NOTE: If the Configure HA Secondary button does not appear, close the tool on both servers, restart the primary HA tool, and start the secondary HA tool.

Click the Configure HA Secondary button. Proceed with the backup for the existing database—the stream from the primary to the secondary should begin after.The initial streaming may take several minutes depending on the amount of data to be replicated.

NOTE: To confirm HA is configured, review the Postgres Status values for both nodes—they should state Running Primary and Running Replica depending on the role.

Verify that you can log in to NPS on both servers.

Upgrades

Before You Begin

Determine if your NPS environment has HA and/or remote services configured


For HA, launch the NPS HA Configuration Tool (NPS.HaMgr) that was packaged with your NPS installer on your primary NPS server. If __Replication Status__ is listed as __Active__, HA is configured


For remote services, launch NPS and check if there are any remote hosts listed under __service nodes__. If there are, you have remote services which will need to be upgraded.

If neither of these are configured, you may proceed with a standard NPS upgrade and bypass the steps outlined in this article. Otherwise, proceed to the appropriate section(s) of this article for HA and/or remote services.

Upgrading from 3.6 or Higher to 3.7CU1 (3.7.1250) or Higher

When upgrading from 3.6, it is assumed that all of your encryption keys are in agreement on all NPS servers and remote service nodes. The 3.7CU1 installer will retain the existing encryption keys on each server, and you can omit any steps in the below instructions involving the export and import of encryption keys.

HA Upgrade Instructions

Summary

Each host in the active/passive configuration must be upgraded, starting with the secondary (passive) host and proceeding to the primary (active) host. After both hosts are upgraded, steps are included to ensure that both NPS installations share the same encryption keys. Once the encryption keys match, the primary and secondary are restored to an HA configuration and their services are re-registered in the NPS console.

Failover and Upgrade the Secondary

1.

Create a new folder in your NPS Installation folder `` C:\Program Files\Stealthbits\PAM\HA Tools ``

2.

Copy the HA Manager Tool from your download directory `` Extras\NPS.HaMgr.exe `` to the NPS installation folder `` C:\Program Files\Stealthbits\PAM\HA Tools. `` If you have an older copy of the HA Tool make sure to copy the existing configuration file over so the tool has the previous configuration values.

3.

Start the HA Manager Tool `` NPS.HaMgr.exe ``.

4.

Click the `` Failover `` button on the HA Tool UI. This will update the PostgreSQL database on the secondary so the upgrade can be performed on the secondary without impacting the primary.

5.

Run `` NPS_Setup `` and click the `` Upgrade Netwrix Privilege Secure `` button.

6.

After the installer completes, close the installer and close `` NPS_Setup ``.

HA Troubleshooting

The following steps will allow you to manually configure critical HA settings on your HA pair.

On the primary server, navigate to the %PROGRAMDATA%\Stealthbits\Postgres12 folder. Refer to the following default path:

C:\ProgramData\Stealthbits\Postgres12

Open the pg_hba.conf file using a text editor. Add the following lines to the end of the file:

host  replication  repuser  %SECONDARY_IP%/32  md5

host  all  all  %SECONDARY_IP%/32  md5

Replace the %SECONDARY_IP% placeholders with the IP address of your secondary server. Save the changes.

On the secondary server, navigate to the %PROGRAMDATA%\Stealthbits\Postgres12 folder. Refer to the following default path:

C:\ProgramData\Stealthbits\Postgres12

Open the pg_hba.conf file using a text editor. Add the following lines to the end of the file:

host  replication  repuser  %PRIMARY_IP%/32  md5

host  all  all  %PRIMARY_IP%/32  md5

Replace the %PRIMARY_IP% placeholders with the IP address of your primary server. Save the changes.
