## Symptoms

In the FSAC System scan log (1-FSAC System Scans_Log.tsv), the following errors are observed:

ERROR TDCThread TDCThread.LoadSourceItf "No DC installed to handle source: FILESYSTEMACCESS"

ERROR TDCThread TDCThread.PrepareForTask "The 'FILESYSTEMACCESS' data collector has not been installed"

## Cause

There is no license for one or more of the following features in Netrix Activity Monitor (NAM):

File System

File System Actions

File System Reports

NOTE: There may only be a license for File Activity in NAM and not for File System Reports, File System Actions, or File System in Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA). Sometimes, leftover reports from a sales or professional services demo may still be present in NEA.

## Resolution

To verify a feature's licensing in NEA, refer to the following steps:

Navigate to Help > About.

Scroll down to the File System Licensed Features section to confirm the licensed features.

If needed, contact the Netwrix Account Owner, Enterprise Account Manager (EAM), or Customer Success Manager (CSM) to negotiate the proper functionality and licensing required for the customer.
