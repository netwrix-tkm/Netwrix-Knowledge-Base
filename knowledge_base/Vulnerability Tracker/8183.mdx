IMPORTANT: This KB article may no longer be accurate or up-to-date.  The installation process described in this article has since been updated, and the steps provided may not align with the current procedures.

## Netwrix Software Installation

Most solutions sold by the sales team will require installation by Netwrix support. Exceptions to this rule are customers who have indicated that they would like to self-install and partner deals. Note, some partners are equipped to install Netwrix while other will require Netwrix support to install for them.

Any installation work will start with support receiving what is termed as a Sales Handover Document. This is in fact an Excel spreadsheet which includes all the salient points agreed with the customer. Examples are particular requirements for the installation and when the installation should proceed.

All installation work will begin with a discovery call. Depending on the size of the implementation this call could be either an entirely separate session or simply the first 5 - 10 minutes of the initial installation session.

__The support manager will assign a support team member to the installation based on resource availability and will forward the Sales Handover Document.__

Netwrix Software Installation Summary of Action

  Receive Sales Handover Document - Revie

  Inform new customer that they will be added to JIR

  Add new customer to JIR

  Arrange discovery call/first sessio

  Document any customer specific aspects of the install (from discovery call) in the success criteria document (downloaded from the paperclip icon above

  If Managed Service customer, arrange meeting schedule during discovery cal

  Create a JIRA case for the instal

  Continue to work with customer until completion of the items on the success criteri

  Attach the completed success criteria document to the JIRA installation cas

  Document anything outstanding by creating JIRA cases (as per the section 'Final Session')

Sales handover document

Review the document, note the type of installation package expected. Likely install packages:

Remote assisted implementation – Quick start install over 3 WebEx session to install and configure an example base, in order with the customer to receive a solid grounding in the Netwrix solutions.

Project managed implementation – More involved. Stay with the customer until the software has been installed completely & customer has signed off the deployment using Netwrix deployment completion form.

Add the New Customer to JIRA

Send the customer an initial email welcoming them to the Netwrix fold and information that they will soon be enrolled in the JIRA Helpdesk Software and attach the file Welcome to the Netwrix Helpdesk Self-Service Portal.pdf.

_Hi ,_

_Many thanks again for choosing to partner with Netwrix, we're very much looking forward to working with you and supporting your use of the Netwrix Solutions._

_By way of a quick introduction to our support portal - we provide all our customers with access to our helpdesk platform. This will enable you to view Netwrix's knowledgebase articles as well as both raising and updating support tickets - all from the comfort of your own desk via this online system._

_Very soon you will receive an email from Jira@supportnntws.atlassian.net asking you to register your details, but in the meantime, the attached is an introductory guide to the new service._

_Any questions, please let me know._

To add a customer to JIRA login to helpdesk with your support account and move to the customer area - https://supportnntws.atlassian.net/projects/HELPDESK/customers

__Add organisation__ - To add an organisational container for the new customer

Enter the new organisation container

__Add customer__ - add the customer using the email address of the customer provided by the sales handover document. Make sure the check box 'Send portal invitation' is ticked and click the 'add' button.

Support Intro Email, Arrangement of Discovery Call/1st Session (Depending on Deal Size)

Agree date and time for initial deployment discovery call discussion with the customer, Netwrix Sales Account Manager to Attend. This call can either be an entirely separate session or form the first 5-10 minutes of the initial session.

An example of an intro email:

_By way of introduction my name is Phill, I am one of the support team members here at Netwrix and I have been assigned as your Netwrix support representative._ _I would like to open negotiations on a date and time when we can get together for our initial discovery call. The discovery call will aid my preparation by identifying the key success criteria and any critical dates we are working towards_.

The Discovery Call

During this call the expectations for the deployment must be identified. The meeting will cover the following points (NOTE: For Quick Start Install this session may be surpassed if the handover information appears to be clear). Agenda for the deployment discovery call will include

  __Definition of the purchase__ - why has the software been purchased

  __Identification of the stakeholders__ - Who will be the users of the Netwrix solutions

  __Confirmation of the technologies__ - Devices to be monitored, Linux, Windows, networ

  __Check if customer will be using their own certificate in IIS_

  __Confirm access to devices__ - Will communication with the proposed monitored devices be a problem? If the device is a network devices, confirm an SSH account is available

  __Discuss the possible software customisations__ - For Change Tracker this will be extension of the templates and compliance reports

  __Dates__ - Are there any dates which we need to be aware of

  __Confirmation of the key deployment objectives__ – Ask the customer to mention what they would consider to be the success criteria (these must be recorded in the success criteria excel spread sheet (attached) and agreed by customer for final sign off

  __If Managed Service customer, arrange schedule for Managed Service call_

  __Agree the date of the first session!__

After the discovery call Netwrix support will summarize the discussed points in a Jira communication, laid out in the same format as 'Example of a post session communication' seen later in this document. Record any customer specific installation requirements in the success criteria document.

__The installation overview document__ (attached) explains what the installation process will involve and what to expect and should be used if the customer wants more detail on the likely process.

Create JIRA Installation Case

If a case has not already been created for the installation, create one now after the discovery call. Ensure that the case contains the following elements

  Summary - Company name, product code and license count New Customer Instal

  Type - New Instal

  Severity - 

  Description - Copy the Product & License and Termed or Perpetual from the Sales Handover Documen

  Add customer contact as the ticket reporte

  Attachments - Attach the success criteria

Approach to Customer Sessions

Research

Using information gathered from the sales handover document, the discovery meeting and the customer's response to the intro email, research deployment requirements. For example, if the deployment involves Solaris, know where the Solaris packages are kept and how to install them. If routers, switches and firewalls are included, know the command to display the configuration for the customer's make and model of device.

Demeanour

There is a high probability as the Netwrix engineer that the tasks you are about to perform, you have completed many times before. However the Netwrix products will be new and fresh to the customer so during the session remain upbeat, listen the customer and make notes as required.

Session Forma

  At the start of each session summarize the tasks that will be undertaken during the session. Reference the Installation Overview Document for order of progress and also take customer input if the customer has an agenda

  Makes notes about items covered during the session

  Finish each session with a brief overview of what has been covered and show the customer within the Netwrix consoles the products of the installation

  Arrange the time and date for the next session

Post Session Actions

After the session, send the customer an communication through JIRA thanking them for their time and also

  Summaries items covered

  List actions on both Netwrix and customer

  Provide details of what will be covered in the next session and confirm the time and date

  If the session was the final install session, state this and complete the steps in the Final Session.
