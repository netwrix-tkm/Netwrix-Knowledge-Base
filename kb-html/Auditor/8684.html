    <h1>How to figure out where a user account was locked out?</h1>
    <h1>Question</h1>

<div>
<p>How to figure out where a user account was locked out with Netwrix Auditor?</p>
</div>

<h1>Answer</h1>

<div>
<p>There are several root causes for account being locked, like wrong password provided by user, when several attempts been made and the user is locked. Also, there might be some services or applications running via the locked out account. The stored credentials become expired and when a service or application attempts to authenticate via the account, it causes failed logon events.</p>
</div>

<div>
<p>With Netwrix Auditor, try the following to learn more about the locked account and find out a reason:</p>

<ol><li>
	<p>Review the User Accounts - Locked report. For that:</p>

	<ul><li>
		<p>On Netwrix Auditor Client home page, click the <b>REPORTS</b> tile in the upper left corner.</p>
		</li><li>
		<p>Expand <b>Predefined</b> <b>Active Directory</b> <b>Active Directory - State-in-Time</b>.</p>
		</li><li>
		<p>Run the <b>User Account - Locked</b> report.</p>
		</li></ul>
	</li><li>
	<p>Run search to see how many failed logons were performed by this user before the account has been locked. For that:</p>

	<ul><li>
		<p>On Netwrix Auditor Client home page, click the <b>SEARCH ACTIVITY RECORDS</b> tile in the upper left corner.</p>
		</li><li>
		<p>Switch to the <b>Advanced</b> view.</p>
		</li><li>
		<p>Apply filters as follows:</p>

		<p>Monitoring plan - Equals -Logon Activity</p>

		<p>Who -Contains - Account Name</p>

		<p>Action - Equals -Failed logon</p>
		</li></ul>
	</li><li>
	<p>Netwrix also suggest searching for the related event ID on the Domain Controller the account was locked from. For example, Event ID 4740 is generated on domain controllers, Windows servers, and workstations every time an account gets locked out, and view the Caller Computer Name in the event details.</p>
	</li><li>
	<p>To track the source of failed logons, enable failed logon auditing on the workstations from which these failed logons were originating. For that:</p>

	<ul><li>
		<p>On the workstation where failed logons occurred, open the <b>Local Security Policy</b> snap-in.</p>
		</li><li>
		<p>Expand <b>Local Policies</b> &gt; <b>Security Options</b> and set the <b>Audit: Force audit policy</b> subcategory settings to <em>Enabled</em>.</p>
		</li><li>
		<p>Navigate to <b>Advanced Audit Policy Configuration</b> &gt; <b>System Audit Policy Configuration</b> <b>Logon\Logoff</b> and set the <b>Audit Logon</b> to Failure.</p>

		<p><span style="color: #2980b9;"><strong>NOTE: </strong></span> If this workstation is subject to a Group Policy configuration, configure audit policies via the <b>Group Policy Configuration</b> snap-in.</p>

		<p>When done, look up failed logon events (typically, Event ID 4625) under the corresponding account in the <b>Security log</b> on these workstations, correlating for date and time of the failed logons seen in Netwrix Auditor reports and/or search results.</p>

		<p>Learn more about failed logon events:</p>

		<ul><li><a href="https://www.ultimatewindowssecurity.com/securitylog/encyclopedia/event.aspx?eventid=4625" target="_blank">Windows Security Log Event ID 4625&#129125;</a></li><li><a href="https://www.ultimatewindowssecurity.com/securitylog/encyclopedia/event.aspx?eventid=4648" target="_blank">Windows Security Log Event ID 4648&#129125;</a></li></ul>

		<p>Â </p>

		<p>Review the events. They might contain information about the process generating the failed logins for a particular user account.</p>
