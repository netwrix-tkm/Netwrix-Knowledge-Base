    <h1>Why Netwrix executable files and dynamic-link library (DLL) files are trying to connect to external IP addresses</h1>
    If access to the Internet on Netwrix server is denied you may see some Netwrix files are trying to connect to IP addresses outside of your organization using HTTP protocol.<br> <br>This is caused by Code signing verification. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_signing" target="_blank">Code signing</a> is the process of digitally signing executables and scripts to confirm the software author and guarantee that the code has not been altered or corrupted since it was signed. The process employs the use of a cryptographic hash to validate authenticity and integrity. Code signing is used on Windows and Mac OS X to authenticate software on first run, ensuring that the software has not been maliciously tampered with by a third-party distributor or download site.<br>The public key used to authenticate the code signature should be traceable back to a trusted root authority CA, preferably using a secure public key infrastructure (PKI).<br> <br>Netwrix files are signed using a certificate that was issued by Symantec Class 3 SHA256 Code Signing CA. Symantec has sold their Certificates Authority business to <a href="https://www.digicert.com/code-signing/" target="_blank">DigiCert</a>. DigiCert root certificates are usually added to Trusted Root Certification Authorities certificate store in latest versions of Windows Server and Windows Desktop operating systems.<br> <br>Being that its not the executable itself connects to eternal IP to verify the signature, its operating system doing that on behalf of an EXE.<br> <br>Since different companies are using different ISPs the route to the trusted CA can be different. Thus the IP addresses an EXE is trying to access to verify signature can also differ.<br> <br>If you want attempts to connect to external IPs to stop you may need to temporary allow internet access on the Netwrix Server so the certificates will be verified and added to trusted CA store on the server. Disabling the Code signing verification is a huge security risk, we do not recommend to do that.<br> <br>Unless you have policy that restricts executing of unverified files enabled, inability to verify files certificates does not cause any problems with collecting the data by Netwrix Auditor
