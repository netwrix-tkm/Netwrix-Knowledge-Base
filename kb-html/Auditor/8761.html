    <h1>How to Add Additional Space to Long-Term Archive</h1>
    <h1>Overview</h1>

<div>
<p>In some cases, you may need to add space to the Long-Term Archive. Please follow the steps below to enhance your archive capacity.</p>
</div>

<h1>Instructions</h1>

<div>
<p><strong>Long-Term Archive</strong> is a file-based storage where Netwrix Auditor saves the collected activity records. By default, it is located on the system drive at <em>%PROGRAMDATA%\Netwrix Auditor\Data</em> and keeps data for <strong>120</strong> <strong>months (10 years) </strong>. The product informs you if you are running out of space on a system disk where it is stored.<br><br>There is a <strong>Long-Term Archive</strong> widget that helps you to monitor the Long-Term Archive capacity. The widget can be found by clicking the <strong>Health Status</strong> tile on the Netwrix Auditor home screen. It displays the current size and daily increase of the Long-Term Archive as well as the remaining free space on the target drive. <br><br>Once the free disk space starts approaching the minimum level, you will see events in the <strong>Netwrix Auditor System Health</strong> log. When the free disk space is less than <strong>3 GB</strong>, the Netwrix services responsible for audit data collection will be stopped, which means that data collection also stops.</p>

<p>Typically, Netwrix recommends adding space (150-200 GB) to the drive where the Long-Term Archive resides to resolve the issue. Follow the steps below to find where your Long-Term Arvice data is stored.</p>

<ol><li>
	<p>In Netwrix Auditor, navigate to <b>Settings</b>.</p>
	</li><li>
	<p>Select the <b>Long-Term Archive</b> page and review where your audit data is written. You can modify the archive retention settings here, however, read the steps below for the correct procedure.</p>
	</li></ol>

<p>In this scenario, all historical data collected by the product will be preserved. If you do not have enough hardware resources for that, add some space (recommended 25-30 GB) on the Auditor Server host to restore regular product functionality and then decrease the retention period of the archive.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><span style="color: #c0392b;"><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong></span> After changing the retention, for example to 1 year, all data older than 1 year will be removed (it might take up to several days) and that freed up even more disk space.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Follow the steps below to decrease the retention period for the archive:</p>

<ol><li>
	<p>Add some space (25-30GB) on the Auditor Server.</p>
	</li><li>
	<p>Shortly after adding additional space, start all Netwrix services.</p>
	</li><li>
	<p>Immediately after that, decrease the Long-Term Archive retention. For that, navigate to the Auditor settings -&gt; <b>Long-Term Archive</b> and click <b>Modify</b> under the Long-term Archive. Then provide a new retention value in months.</p>
	</li></ol>

<p>It is up to you to decide how long you want to keep historical data. If you know that no historical data will be needed past one year, decrease the retention to <b>12 months</b>. The historical data can be imported from the Archive back to your Audit Database when needed via the <b>Investigations</b> feature.</p>
