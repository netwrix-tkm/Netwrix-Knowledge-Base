    <h1>Information About Foreign Group Members (Foreign Security Principals) Missing in Active Directory State-in-time Reports</h1>
    <h1>Symptom</h1>

<div>
<p>The Active Directory state-in-time reports based on historical snapshots do not contain data for foreign group members (Foreign security principals).</p>
</div>

<div>
<h1>Cause</h1>

<div>
<p>An Active Directory domain contains the information about the objects and their attributes belonging to this domain. The <b>Group Members</b> report uses a cross-domain membership feature, it means that data collected in different monitoring plans then aggregated to show the final membership. Thus, the product cannot work with historical snapshots, because there is no guarantee that historical snapshots for other domains are also uploaded and all of them were taken at the same time, i.e., the data from other monitoring plans that could be collected at different time cannot be shown in the reports.</p>
</div>

<h1>Resolution</h1>

<div>
<p>Information about foreign group membersÂ (Foreign security principals) available only in the state-in-time reports based on a current session. This is expected behavior of the product.</p>
