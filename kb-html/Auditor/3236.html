    <h1>Long Data Collection  Improving the Performance</h1>
    <h2>Question</h2>

<div>
<p>Data collection takes too long to complete. How to improve the Netwrix Auditor performance to speed up the data collection?</p>
</div>

<h2>Answer</h2>

<div>
<p>The following recommendations will allow you to improve the overall Auditor performance.</p>
</div>

<h4>Split data sources in separate monitoring plans</h4>

<div>
<p>For the initial setup and post-setup stages, it is highly recommended to stick to the following structure:</p>

<ul><li>
	<p>One database per monitoring plan.</p>
	</li><li>
	<p>One monitoring plan per data source.</p>
	</li></ul>

<blockquote>
<p><strong><span style="color: #2980b9;">NOTE: </span></strong>It is possible to split collections of specific data sources in multiple monitoring plans, although it is important to considering the following:</p>

<ul><li>
	<p>SQL edition (Express or Standard or other).</p>
	</li><li>
	<p>Average number of activity records of your single data source.</p>
	</li><li>
	<p>Hardware limitations.</p>
	</li></ul>
</blockquote>

<p>In general, it is recommended to use different databases for different data sources to avoid rapid database size growth and ease the troubleshooting process. For additional information on creation of monitoring plans, refer to the following article: <a href="https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/Auditor_10.6/page/Content/Auditor/Admin/MonitoringPlans/Overview.htm" target="_self">Monitoring Plans</a>.</p>
</div>

<h4>Hardware limitations</h4>

<div>
<p>In case of recent changes to your environment that led to hindered performance, refer to the following article for reference on hardware requirements for your infrastructure: <a href="https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/Auditor_10.6/page/Content/Auditor/Requirements/Hardware.htm" target="_self">Hardware Requirements</a>.</p>
</div>

<h4>Network traffic compression</h4>

<div>
<p>To reduce network traffic in distributed deployments, multi-site networks, and other environments with remote locations that have limited bandwidth, it is recommended to use network traffic compression. This option also helps reduce the CPU load for the Netwrix Auditor host  for additional information on setting up traffic compression, refer to the following article: <a href="https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/Auditor_10.6/page/Content/Auditor/Admin/HealthStatus/NetworkTrafficCompression.htm" target="_self">Network Traffic Compression</a>.</p>
</div>

<h4>Decrease database retention period</h4>

<div>
<p>Depending on your environment and needs, the Audit Database retention period can be either increased or decreased. It should be noted, that higher retention period for any database will also lead to greater database sizes and longer times to search for stored data. For additional information on setting a database retention period, refer to the following article: <a href="https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/Auditor_10.6/page/Content/Auditor/Admin/Settings/AuditDatabase.htm#configure_database_retention" target="_self">Audit Database  Configure Database Retention</a>.</p>
</div>

<h4>Exclude Netwrix-related folders from antivirus scans</h4>

<div>
<p>As Netwrix Auditor creates and writes audit data in smaller portions, your antivirus suite will attempt to check every new or edited file to complete the threat check. Full file reads might take extra time to complete, hindering the writing capability of Netwrix Auditor, in some cases leading to timeouts and additional RAM and CPU loads. Refer to the following article for additional information on folders to be excluded from regular antivirus checks: <a href="https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/z-kb-articles-salesforce/page/kA04u0000000HirCAE.html" target="_self">Antivirus Exclusions for Netwrix Auditor</a>.</p>
</div>

<h4>Set up data collection for State-in-Time reports</h4>

<div>
<p>Some collectors allow for scheduling of State-in-Time data collection  increasing the time window between these events will help to avoid resource consumption spikes. Same applies to Activity Summary reports  increasing the time window between these reports will allow you to decrease the momentary loads. Both these changes won&#39;t affect the overall resource consumption, they will distribute the consumption evenly. Refer to the following article for additional information on editing data sources: <a href="https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/Auditor_10.6/page/Content/Auditor/Admin/MonitoringPlans/DataSources.htm" target="_self">Manage Data Sources</a>.</p>
</div>

<h4>Specify domain controllers and Exchange servers for data collection</h4>

<div>
<p>You can specify DCs and Exchange servers to collect data from  this allows to mitigate the effects of decreased network availability, the hardware underperformance, and distance to the Netwrix host of domain controllers and Exchange servers. Refer to dclist.txt, dirsyncdclist.txt, and aal_serverlist.txt files to list the closest and most reliable DCs and Exchange servers.</p>
</div>

<h4>Group membership</h4>

<div>
<p>Group membership data is collected to include information on group membership of the account that performed a change or an action. Disabling the group membership data collection will reduce the monitoring scope to the audited domain only, but this might increase the overall Active Directory Auditing performance as Netwrix Auditor won&#39;t have to query global catalogs in the forest. Refer to the following steps to disable the group membership monitoring:</p>

<ol><li>
	<p>Select your monitoring plan and click <strong>Edit</strong>.</p>
	</li><li>
	<p>Select the appropriate data source and click <strong>Edit data source</strong> in the right pane.</p>
	</li><li>
	<p>Select the <strong>General</strong> tab in the left pane.</p>
	</li><li>
	<p>Uncheck the <strong>Group membership</strong> under the <strong>Detect additional details</strong> section.</p>
	</li></ol>
</div>

<h4>Event Log Manager</h4>

<div>
<p>In case you have an Event Log Manager plan set up, make sure it doesn&#39;t monitor data covered by one of your Netwrix Auditor monitoring plans to avoid redundant monitoring data and performance impact. Refer to the following steps to can disable event log collection via Event Log Manager:</p>

<ol><li>
	<p>Launch Netwrix Auditor Event Log Manager.</p>
	</li><li>
	<p>Select your monitoring plan and click <strong>Edit</strong>.</p>
	</li><li>
	<p>In the top left corner, uncheck the <strong>Enable event log collection</strong> checkbox and click <strong>Save</strong>.</p>
	</li></ol>
</div>

<h4>Omit lists</h4>

<div>
<p>You can limit the monitoring scope in your environment via omit lists  this allows to proactively decrease the DB loads as changes for omitted items are not recorded. For additional information on how to exclude users and objects via Netwrix Auditor UI, refer to the following article: <a href="https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/z-kb-articles-salesforce/page/kA04u000000PoL2CAK.html" target="_blank">How to Exclude Users and Objects from Monitoring Scope in Netwrix Auditor UI</a>. For additional information on available omit lists, review the corresponding article applicable to your target system. For example, for Active Directory omit lists, refer to the following article: <a href="https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/Auditor_10.6/page/Content/Auditor/Admin/MonitoringPlans/ActiveDirectory/Scope.htm" target="_blank">Monitoring Plans  Active Directory Plans  Active Directory Monitoring Scope</a>.</p>
