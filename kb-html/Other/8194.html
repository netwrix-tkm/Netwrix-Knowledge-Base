A brief summary of the sales messages describing how the software aids an organisations cybersecurity posture are detailed here.</p><h2 id="SupportProcess-SoftwareEngagementApproach-_Toc475087729SalesMessagesSummary"><span class="confluence-anchor-link conf-macro output-inline" id="SupportProcess-SoftwareEngagementApproach-_Toc475087729"><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="_Toc475087729"> </span></span>Sales Messages Summary</h2><p><strong>Make sure systems are fit for purpose</strong> - Assess a system&#39;s vulnerability. This should be priority number one, make sure that all systems are fit for purpose by removing all vulnerabilities. Prevention is much more desired than capture, there is little point installing cctv cameras in your home if all the doors and windows are unlocked and opened. (Feel free to use your own example!)<br><strong>Handle change within the environment</strong> - Once systems are secure, monitor their configuration to identify change which could introduce vulnerabilities and monitor the file system to detect malicious activity. Monitoring systems for change is very much a strength in depth approach. AV is a must for recognising and eliminating known threats, if a threat is unknown to AV or a zero day attack then a file integrity solution is essential to alert organisations to unexpected changes.<br><strong>Provide context to the change</strong> - It is important that when changes are identified, that you are able to provide the context of why there was a change. Did this change relate to a patch or application upgrade?</p><h2 id="SupportProcess-SoftwareEngagementApproach-_Toc475087730TobeConfigured,DemonstratedorExplainedinAllWebex"><span class="confluence-anchor-link conf-macro output-inline" id="SupportProcess-SoftwareEngagementApproach-_Toc475087730"><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="_Toc475087730"> </span></span>To be Configured, Demonstrated or Explained in All Webex</h2><p>It is important that all employees of Netwrix align with these messages. As support representatives we are arguably the best placed to communicate and expand the messages by ensuring, during each WebEx interaction with either prospect or customer, that the below features are explaining.</p><h3 id="SupportProcess-SoftwareEngagementApproach-_Toc475087731DemonstrateCISCompliancereports"><span class="confluence-anchor-link conf-macro output-inline" id="SupportProcess-SoftwareEngagementApproach-_Toc475087731"><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="_Toc475087731"> </span></span><span style="color: rgb(31,77,120);"><strong>Demonstrate CIS Compliance reports</strong></span></h3><p>Netwrix are advocates of prevention rather than cure! Demonstrate the CIS compliance reports and how they ensure a system is fit for purpose. Identify a couple of rules which you feel comfortable explaining and show the remediation steps contained within the report.</p><h3 id="SupportProcess-SoftwareEngagementApproach-_Toc475087732ExplaintheNNTRemediationKits"><span class="confluence-anchor-link conf-macro output-inline" id="SupportProcess-SoftwareEngagementApproach-_Toc475087732"><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="_Toc475087732"> </span></span>Explain the Netwrix Remediation Kits</h3><p>Hand in glove with the compliance reports are the Netwrix Remediation Kits. Available for both Windows via GPO or UNIX/Linux via scripts, these kits which are available to customers only (don&#39;t provide them in the POC) enable system to be quickly configured to match the suggested secure configuration of a compliance report.</p><h3 id="SupportProcess-SoftwareEngagementApproach-_Toc475087733Demonstratecloseloopintelligentchangecontrol"><span class="confluence-anchor-link conf-macro output-inline" id="SupportProcess-SoftwareEngagementApproach-_Toc475087733"><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="_Toc475087733"> </span></span>Demonstrate close loop intelligent change control</h3><p>Setup a decent amount of CLICC planned changes to demonstrate the different CLICC configurations. Show the pre and post change configuration and describe how this is providing the context of the change. <em>&quot;We have recorded the changes generated by an application update. Now if we apply these changes to all system which will accept this application update, Change Tracker will automatically recognise the changes as good known changes.&quot;</em></p><h3 id="SupportProcess-SoftwareEngagementApproach-_Toc475087734ExplaintheEventsActionbutton"><span class="confluence-anchor-link conf-macro output-inline" id="SupportProcess-SoftwareEngagementApproach-_Toc475087734"><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="_Toc475087734"> </span></span>Explain the Events Action button</h3><p>From the events page run the prospect through the event action options, describing each one and how they subtly differ to meet different planned change scenarios.<br><strong>When setting up planned changes be deliberately general with the specifics of what the planned change will match and also generous with the time window. Inevitably once a prospect is left alone to test the product, they will make changes and we would prefer that some of these changes are identified as planned.</strong></p><h3 id="SupportProcess-SoftwareEngagementApproach-_Toc475087735ExplainthebreadthoftheCustomplannedchange"><span class="confluence-anchor-link conf-macro output-inline" id="SupportProcess-SoftwareEngagementApproach-_Toc475087735"><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="_Toc475087735"> </span></span>Explain the breadth of the Custom planned change</h3><p>To the uninitiated our custom planned change filter will look complex so spend some time explaining this feature to customers. In a POC it would be best to try not to get drawn into setting up examples. It should suffice to say that any parameter which Change Tracker tracks can be used within the custom filter. Provide the below as explanations:<br><em>&quot;We can monitor an important log file which will change often but only create an unplanned change if the size reduces. The implication here is that potential data has been removed from the file.&quot;</em><br><em>&quot;Changes made by a specific user, we would not advocate this but is works as an example of what is possible. If all changes during a patch run will be installed from the same service account, these changes can be waved through as planned changes. Any changes made by another account will appear as unplanned.&quot;</em><br>If setting up as an example is unavoidable then I have put all the current examples in a separate article.</p><h3 id="SupportProcess-SoftwareEngagementApproach-_Toc475087736NNTFASTCloud"><span class="confluence-anchor-link conf-macro output-inline" id="SupportProcess-SoftwareEngagementApproach-_Toc475087736"><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="_Toc475087736"> </span></span>Netwrix FAST Cloud</h3><p>Take every opportunity to talk about FAST Cloud with existing customers.<span class="confluence-anchor-link conf-macro output-inline" id="SupportProcess-SoftwareEngagementApproach-_GoBack"><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="_GoBack"> </span></span> <br><em>&quot;An Netwrix cloud based offering which leverages continually updated reputational intelligence from leading manufactures to build an all-encompassing whitelist of known good and bad files. Change Tracker can query this whitelist to automatically investigate changes, drastically reducing the change noise which is the challenge for all security professional.&quot;</em></p>
