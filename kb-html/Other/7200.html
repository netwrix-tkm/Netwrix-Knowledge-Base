    <h1>Producing memory dumps for different components of Threat Prevention</h1>
    <p><strong><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large">Summary:</span></strong> The purpose of this kb article is to provide instructions on producing/collecting memory dumps for different components of the Threat Prevention product</p>
<p><strong><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large">Issue:</span></strong> <br>A process memory dump is a snapshot of process memory, which might include additional information such as stack trace, threads, handles etc. It can help software developers to diagnose, identify and resolve problems that lead to application failure.<br>Typical types of application failures include:<br>1. Application hangs<br>2. Application crashes<br>3. Application consumes more memory than expected or doesn&#39;t release memory.<br>4. Application works incorrectly<br>Process memory dumps can help to diagnose / troubleshoot cases 1-3. Dump files generally are not the best tool for troubleshooting case 4.<br>Thus, depending on the type of application failure, there are two types of process memory dumps we are most interested in:<br>- Hang dumps / Dump of application when it is in a &#39;bad&#39; state<br>- Crash dumps<br>Hang dumps are useful for troubleshooting the case of a &#39;hung&#39; or &#39;frozen&#39; processes. In some cases they may help to troubleshoot processes that are in an &#39;idle&#39; state (process is doing nothing, although should be really busy). They also can help for investigating abnormal memory consumption or troubleshooting memory/resource leaks. Producing a hang dump is typically initiated by the user.<br><br>Crash dumps are used for identifying the reason a process crashes. Crash dumps are produced automatically by a dump creation tool once the tool is configured properly.<br><br>FAQ:<br>Q: How to understand the process is crashing / was crashing?<br>A: The easiest way is to review Windows Event logs. System or Application event log should contain related errors inside. Another way is compare process PID with initial process PID - if PIDs are different then there was a crash or the process was restarted. The last way is to review logs. Most SI components write special entries into their log file every time their process / service starts.<br><br>Q: What should I do if process is crashing?<br>A: Collect &#39;crash&#39; dump<br><br>Q: What should I do if process is &#39;hung&#39; or doing nothing at the time it should really be busy or consumes a lot of CPU when it should be idle.<br>A: Collect &#39;hang&#39; dump<br><br>Q: What should I do in other cases?<br>A: Dumps are unlikely to help, but logs still can. Please collect logs.</p>
