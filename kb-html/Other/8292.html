    <h1>Support Process - Out of Hours Support</h1>
    <p> If there is a need to work on a Saturday, or you have worked into the evening, then time off in lieu will be provided. This is not to say that we just agree to work at weekends at a customers request. We will always initially push back, our support hours do not cover the weekend but on special occasions and only when there is agreement with the supporting representative, a weekend session can be organised.</p><p><br></p><p>Also, as we progress through Supports follow the sun operation, there may be a need for the UK to handover to the US or the East Coast to the West Coast as the days end. This would only be is extreme circumstances when dropping the support session and rearranging for the following day is not viable or you feel that you cannot see the session through to the bitter end &#128522;. Therefore, if you feel that the session you are running will overrun your end of day and you want to pass it on then it is your responsibility to prep for the handover and consider the following:</p><p><br>1. Alert the support resource that youll be handing over to as early as possible.<br>2. If possible, have the support resource join the call for the tail end of your time.<br>3. Tell the customer, once again as early as possible, that you will be handing over to another resource.<br>4. If needed end the customer session and call/webex with the resource you will be handing over to for a non-customer briefing. This is at your discretion.</p>
